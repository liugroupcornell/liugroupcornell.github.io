However, unlikethe remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, thegrowth of two-dimensional material heterostructures across atomic layershas been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here we report thedouble-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes.We grow vdW topological insulators Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> andBi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> by molecular-beam epitaxy on both surfacesof atomically thin graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, which serve assuspended two-dimensional vdW substrate layers. Both homo- andhetero-double-sided vdW topological insulator tunnel junctions arefabricated, with the atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride acting as acrystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxialinterfaces. By performing field-angle-dependent magneto-tunnellingspectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy-momentum-spinresonance of massless Dirac electrons tunnelling between helical Landaulevels developed in the topological surface states at theinterfaces.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-02079-5"><i>Nat.Mater.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Design, synthesis andprocessing, Electronic and spintronic devices, Surfaces, interfaces andthin films, Topological insulators, Two-dimensional materials</span></p><h3id="platinum-hydride-formation-during-cathodic-corrosion-in-aqueous-solutions">Platinumhydride formation during cathodic corrosion in aqueous solutions</h3><p>Original Paper | Corrosion | 2025-01-21 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Thomas J.

Although cathodic corrosionprobably occurs by forming a metal-containing anion, such intermediatespecies have not yet been observed. Here, aiming to resolve thislong-standing debate, our work provides such evidence through X-rayabsorption spectroscopy. High-energy-resolution X-ray absorptionnear-edge structure experiments are used to characterize platinumnanoparticles during cathodic corrosion in 10 mol l<sup>-1</sup> NaOH.These experiments detect minute chemical changes in the Pt duringcorrosion that match first-principles simulations of X-ray absorptionspectra of surface platinum multilayer hydrides. Thus, this worksupports the existence of hydride-like platinum during cathodiccorrosion. Notably, these results provide a direct observation of thesespecies under conditions where they are highly unstable and whereprominent hydrogen bubble formation interferes with most spectroscopymethods. Therefore, this work identifies the elusive intermediate thatunderlies cathodic corrosion.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-02080-y"><i>Nat.Mater.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Corrosion</span></p><h2 id="nature-physics">Nature Physics</h2><h3id="programmable-simulations-of-molecules-and-materials-with-reconfigurable-quantum-processors">Programmablesimulations of molecules and materials with reconfigurable quantumprocessors</h3><p>Original Paper | Electronic structure of atoms and molecules |2025-01-21 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Nishad Maskara, StefanOstermann, James Shee, Marcin Kalinowski, Abigail McClain Gomez, RodrigoAraiza Bravo, Derek S.

However, realizing practical quantum advantage for suchproblems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost ofprogramming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce asimulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems representedby model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architecturesto simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach alsointroduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectralproperties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results.We develop a digital-analogue simulation toolbox for efficientHamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering andhardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complexspin-spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementationbased on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectralinformation can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshotmeasurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation ofexcitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from asingle dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use themethod to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metalcatalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02738-z"><i>Nat.Phys.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Electronic structure of atomsand molecules, Magnetic properties and materials, Quantum chemistry,Quantum information, Quantum simulation</span></p><h3 id="free-electron-quantum-optics">Free-electron quantum optics</h3><p>Review Paper | Matter waves and particle beams | 2025-01-21 19:00EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Ron Ruimy, Aviv Karnieli, IdoKaminer</span></p><p>Recent theoretical and experimental breakthroughs have given rise tothe emerging field of free-electron quantum optics, reshaping theunderstanding of free-electron physics. Traditionally rooted inclassical electrodynamics, this field now reveals quantum-mechanicalfeatures that necessitate the frameworks of quantum electrodynamics andquantum optics. This shift compels a re-evaluation of well-establishedareas, bringing quantum-mechanical corrections to accelerator scienceand to electron-radiation phenomena. Simultaneously, the ability toshape single-electron wavefunctions opens new possibilities inmicroscopy and spectroscopy. These developments are primarily driven byinnovations in electron microscopy and its intersection with laserscience, where laser-driven electron modulation substantially influencesquantum electron interactions with light and matter. In thisPerspective, we review these developments, highlighting the currentchallenges and future opportunities. We explore the role of the freeelectron as a quantum resource, complementing conventional two-levelsystems and harmonic oscillators. In the coming years, free electronsmay offer new modalities for reading and writing quantum information onultrafast timescales, performing quantum-state tomography, and ultrafastquantum gates on the atomic scale.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02743-2"><i>Nat.Phys.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Matter waves and particlebeams, Quantum optics</span></p><h2 id="nature-reviews-physics">Nature Reviews Physics</h2><h3id="principles-for-demonstrating-condensed-phase-optical-refrigeration">Principlesfor demonstrating condensed phase optical refrigeration</h3><p>Review Paper | Materials for optics | 2025-01-21 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Zhuoming Zhang, Yang Ding,Peter J.

This non-contact, vibration-free, opticallyaddressable cooling technique opens up many application possibilities,ranging from high-resolution space-based imaging to the stabilization ofultraprecise frequency combs. The field has seen rapid progress in thepast 25 years, from the first cooling of a rare-earth-doped glass by 0.3K in 1995 to reaching cryogenic temperatures around 90 K inytterbium-doped fluoride crystals in 2018. Attention has now shifted tosemiconductors with higher cooling power densities and predicted coolingfloors as low as 10 K. This has stimulated a race to demonstrate theoptical refrigeration of a semiconductor. It is therefore timely tosystematize the necessary and sufficient experimental minimum criteriafor reporting optical refrigeration results to elevate the reliabilityand reproducibility of current and future optical refrigeration claims.In this Expert Recommendation, we propose four principles and provideguidelines for verifying and reporting new cooling results: opticalcooling metrics, demonstrations of explicit heating versus cooling,thermodynamic consistency and reliable temperature measurements. Wefurther propose that these principles serve as a guide for reviewingliterature claims in the field.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-024-00804-2"><i>NatRev Phys</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials for optics,Semiconductors</span></p><h2 id="arxiv">arXiv</h2><h3id="band-structure-and-pairing-nature-of-la_3ni_2o_7-thin-film-at-ambient-pressure">BandStructure and Pairing Nature of La<spanclass="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Ni<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<spanclass="math inline">\(_7\)</span> Thin Film at Ambient Pressure</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Shao,+Z">Zhi-YanShao</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Liu,+Y">Yu-BoLiu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Liu,+M">MinLiu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+F">FanYang</a></span></p><p>Recently, evidences of superconductivity with onset temperature <spanclass="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> above the McMillan limit (<spanclass="math inline">\(\approx 40\)</span> K) have been detected in theLa<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Ni<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<spanclass="math inline">\(_7\)</span> ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlOsubstrate at ambient pressure.

The ability to design sign-changing gap givesrise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is agateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work,we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-likemicrowave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. Thedirection and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering theaxially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate threelattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59%of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. Thisis obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measuredmicrowave resonance frequencies.

In thiswork, we present a new approach to enhance the performance ofnanomechanical resonators featuring integrated microfluidic channelswhen they are used as cell sensors by means of applying hydrostaticcompressions. For this purpose, we have studied analytically how thiskind of compressions affects either the mechanical properties of theresonator as well as the analytes. We found that, depending on factorssuch as device geometry and material composition, the mass limit ofdetection of the resonator can be reduced while the buoyant mass of theparticles is increased when a hydrostatic compression is applied,improving the performance of the sensor. Furthermore, we demonstratethat applying these hydrostatic compressions induces shifts in massdistributions among cell lines with similar physical properties, whichnot only potentially enhances the ability to differentiate between theselines, but also opens the door to measure the cell's compressibility, abiophysical parameter of interest with practical diagnosticapplications.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10439"><em>arXiv:2501.10439</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other), BiologicalPhysics (physics.bio-ph)</span></p><h3id="pilot-study-of-electrochemical-reduction-of-selected-nucleotides-and-double-stranded-dna-at-pristine-micro-ultrananocrystalline-boron-doped-diamond-electrodes-at-very-negative-potentials">Pilotstudy of electrochemical reduction of selected nucleotides anddouble-stranded DNA at pristine micro-/ultrananocrystalline boron-dopeddiamond electrodes at very negative potentials</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=August%C3%ADn,+M">MichalAugustín</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Vysko%C4%8Dil,+V">VlastimilVyskočil</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Szab%C3%B3,+O">OndrejSzabó</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dragounov%C3%A1,+K+A">KateřinaAubrechtová Dragounová</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Pfeifer,+R">RenePfeifer</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Matysik,+F">Frank-MichaelMatysik</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Barek,+J">JiříBarek</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Marton,+M">MariánMarton</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kromka,+A">AlexanderKromka</a></span></p><p>Pristine polycrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) --microcrystalline (B-MCDE) and ultrananocrystalline (B-UNCDE) wereapplied for the electrochemical reduction of several selected purinenucleotides -- Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP), 2'-Deoxyguanosine5'-monophosphate (dGMP), Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), Adenosine5'-diphosphate (ADP), Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), and pyrimidinenucleotides -- Cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP), Thymidine5'-monophosphate (TMP), as well as low-molecular-weight double-strandedDNA (dsDNA) at very negative potentials via linear sweep voltammetry(LSV).

These processes are oftencharacterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with theenvironment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations indiffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion isobserved, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linearscaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon,fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process,particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations.Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneousprocesses with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. Inthis article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractionalBrownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBMprocess varies while temporal correlations are maintained. Tocharacterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common toolused to quantify deviations from the normal distribution.

Rubidium (Rb) is one of the largest alkali metals and theone less investigated as intercalant. Here, we report a systematicinvestigation, with a multi-technique approach, of the phase formationof Rb under epitaxial monolayer graphene on SiC(0001). We explore a widephase space with two control parameters: the Rb density (i.e.,deposition time) and sample temperature (i.e., room- andlow-temperature). We reveal the emergence of <spanclass="math inline">\((2 \times 2)\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\((\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})\)</span>R30° structuresformed by a single alkali metal layer intercalated between monolayergraphene and the interfacial C-rich reconstructed surface, also known asbuffer layer. Rb intercalation also results in a strong n-type doping ofthe graphene layer. Progressively annealing to high temperatures, wefirst reveal diffusion of Rb atoms which results in the enlargement ofintercalated areas. As desorption sets in, intercalated regionsprogressively shrink and fragment. Eventually, at approximately 600°Cthe initial surface is retrieved, indicating the reversibility of theintercalation process.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10477"><em>arXiv:2501.10477</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="driving-a-quantum-phase-transition-at-arbitrary-rate-exact-solution-of-the-transverse-field-ising-model">Drivinga Quantum Phase Transition at Arbitrary Rate: Exact solution of theTransverse-Field Ising model</h3><p>New Submission | Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) |2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Grabarits,+A">AndrásGrabarits</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Balducci,+F">FedericoBalducci</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=del+Campo,+A">Adolfodel Campo</a></span></p><p>We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in thetransverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at anarbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to thesudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, thecomplete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion ofa linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of themodel using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations,along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode interms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of theproblem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated withindependent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a successprobability <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>.

When the latter is approximated by theLandau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurekmechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-lawbehavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in thelaboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, thecumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on thedriving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kinknumber statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, asrevealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that varynonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime.

We report results of micro-focused angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagneticnature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the bandstructure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk singlecrystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, theexperimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show asemi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for thenonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for theantiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies anegligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggestthe absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting.Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one nearthe Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively,both of which are attributed to the topological surface statesassociated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES resultssuggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topologicalsurface/interface states need to be taken into account to properlycapture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10649"><em>arXiv:2501.10649</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">29 pages, 9figures</span></p><h3id="magnetic-switching-of-phonon-angular-momentum-in-a-ferrimagnetic-insulator">Magneticswitching of phonon angular momentum in a ferrimagnetic insulator</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wu,+F">FangliangWu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhou,+J">JingZhou</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Bao,+S">SongBao</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+L">LiangyueLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wen,+J">JinshengWen</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wan,+Y">YuanWan</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+Q">QiZhang</a></span></p><p>Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route formediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phononangular momentum without altering the material's structure orcomposition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatileswitching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsicferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons withgiant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due tospontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magneticfield, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches canbe switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the criticaltemperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopicmodel based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations.Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with oppositephonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologicallyprotected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These resultsdemonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, andpave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometerscale.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10650"><em>arXiv:2501.10650</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="role-of-random-interaction-connection-in-the-order-transition-of-active-matter-based-on-the-vicsek-model">Roleof Random Interaction Connection in the Order Transition of ActiveMatter Based on the Vicsek Model</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jin,+R">RuizhiJin</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dong,+K">KejunDong</a></span></p><p>Randomness plays a key role in the order transition of active matterbut has not yet been explicitly considered in pairwise interactionconnection.

Aiming to open a new application field for MXenes inthe realm of electronic devices such as ultrahigh-integrated magneticmemory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structureconsisting of bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO usingmagnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrate the field-freecurrent-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the Hall-crossconfiguration with the critical current density of ~30 MA/cm2. Anattempt to replace the Cr2N layer by the Pt layer leads to the absenceof field-free CIMS. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing theCr2N thickness, the first-principles calculation predicts the pronouncedorbital-Hall conductivity in the out-of-plane component, compared to thespin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroismreveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2Nlayer at the interface, by contacting with Co in the [Co/Pt]3ferromagnetic layer. The interfacial spin-filtering-like effect againstthe out-of-plane polarized spin owing to the uncompensated magneticmoment of Cr might be a possible cause for the field-free CIMS.

Microwave-assistedsynthesis and processing is a burgeoning subject matter in materialsresearch with significant strides in the realm of nanocarbon during thelast decade. The review examines recent approaches to producing variousnanocarbons using microwaves as energy sources, the characterization ofsuch materials for various applications, and their results. Theunderlying factors supporting the increased performance of suchmaterials or their composites are analyzed and reaction mechanisms arepresented wherever necessary. In particular, the recently developed andverified approaches to produce porous carbon materials, CNTs and fibers,carbon nanospheres, carbon dots, CQDs, reduced graphene oxide,nanocarbon hybrid materials, and the purification and modification ofCNTs are discussed. The reduction of graphene oxide and the preparationof graphene derivative hybrids using solid-state and liquid-state routessuch as polyopl, mixed solvents, ionic liquids, and microwave-assistedhydrothermal/solvothermal methods are analyzed in detail. In addition,the principles of microwave heating in liquid and solid states, the useof metals particles as arcing agents or catalysts, and carbonaceousmaterials as internal or external susceptors during synthesis andmodifications are presented in detail.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10706"><em>arXiv:2501.10706</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Journal of Energy Storage2025, 111, 115315</span></p><h3id="optimal-control-for-preparing-fractional-quantum-hall-states-in-optical-lattices">Optimalcontrol for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in opticallattices</h3><p>New Submission | Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wu,+L">Ling-NaWu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+X">XikunLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Goldman,+N">NathanGoldman</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+B">BotaoWang</a></span></p><p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a keychallenge for quantum simulators.

Using molecular dynamicssimulations and classical nucleation theory, we show that pure waterconfined within defect-free walls can withstand extreme negativepressures, far beyond those observed experimentally. Hydrophobicsurfaces trigger heterogeneous cavitation and lower the cavitationpressure magnitude, but not to experimental levels. Notably, a singlenanoscopic surface defect capable of hosting a vapor bubble drasticallyreduces the tensile strength of water. We find that defects as small as1-2 nm can act as effective cavitation nuclei, a scale smaller thanpredicted by simple mechanical stability arguments. This discrepancyarises from stochastic fluctuations of the vapor bubble, which canovercome the kinetic free-energy barrier for cavitation. Our findingsshow that cavitation is predominantly determined by the largest surfacedefect rather than the overall defect density, emphasizing theimportance of eliminating the largest surface imperfections to enhancestability against cavitation.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10776"><em>arXiv:2501.10776</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph), Fluid Dynamics(physics.flu-dyn)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">10 pages, 7figures</span></p><h3id="boundary-curvature-dependent-dynamical-trapping-of-undulating-worms">Boundarycurvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kapadia,+S">SohumKapadia</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kudrolli,+A">ArshadKudrolli</a></span></p><p>We investigate the behavior of {} in polygonal chambers and show thatthe worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and getdynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of timebefore escaping.

Recent studies, however, showed that metalscan deliver ultra-high thermoelectric power factors (PFs) under certainconditions. In this work, we theoretically examine the electronicstructure and electronic transport specifications which allow for suchhigh PFs. Using Boltzmann transport (BTE) simulations and a multi-bandelectronic structure model, we show that metals with: i) high degree oftransport asymmetry between their bands, ii) strong inter-bandscattering, and iii) a large degree of band overlap, can provideultra-high power factors. We show that each of these characteristicsadds to the steepness of the transport distribution function of the BTE,which allows for an increase of the Seebeck coefficient to sizablevalues, simultaneously with an increase in the electrical conductivity.This work generalizes the concept that transport asymmetry (i.e.,mixture of energy regions of high and low contributions to theelectrical conductivity), through a combination of different bandmasses, scattering strengths, or energy filtering scenarios, etc., canindeed result in very high thermoelectric power factors, even in theabsence of a material bandgap. Under certain conditions, transportasymmetry can over-compensate any performance degradation to the PF dueto bipolar conduction and the naturally low Seebeck coefficients thatotherwise exist in this class of materials.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10790"><em>arXiv:2501.10790</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">paper and supportinginformation, 50 pages</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">PRX Energy 3, 043009,2024</span></p><h3id="tuning-magnetism-in-graphene-nanoribbons-via-strain-and-adatoms">Tuningmagnetism in graphene nanoribbons via strain and adatoms</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Moles,+P">PabloMoles</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Santos,+H">HernánSantos</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dom%C3%ADnguez-Adame,+F">FranciscoDomínguez-Adame</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Chico,+L">LeonorChico</a></span></p><p>We investigate the impact of strain and adsorbed H adatoms on themagnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using acombination of tight-binding and density functional theory methods forboth, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic edge configurations(AFM). Our study reveals that longitudinal strain induces a significantenhancement in the edge magnetic moment, that we attribute tostrain-driven modifications in the band structure. In addition, wedescribe H~adatoms within the tight-binding approach by employing bothan unrelaxed vacancy model and the Anderson impurity model. By comparingto density functional theory results, we corroborate that the Andersonimpurity model is best suited to describe H adsorption. We then focus onthe metallic FM edge configuration of the ZGNRs to better exploit thetuning of its properties. We find that the magnetic configuration ofH~adatoms is strongly influenced by the edges, with an AFM couplingbetween edges and the H~adatom. In fact, the magnetic spatial pattern ofthe H adatom differs to that found in graphene due to this edgecoupling. Importantly, we find robust discrete plateaus of integermagnetic moment as strain is varied in the defected ZGNRs, that werelate to changes in the band structure, namely, a half-metalliccharacter or the opening of a gap.

The use of increasinglypure superconducting coatings for accelerating cavities, with lower andlower RF losses, determined such high-quality factors that the need tooperate at low temperatures (below the superconducting transitiontemperature Tc) was well paid for.

Althoughsignificant advances have been made in understanding the statics anddynamics of cohesionless grains over the past decades, most granularsystems we encounter often display some adhesive forces between grains.The presence of cohesion has effects at distances substantially largerthan the closest neighbors and consequently can greatly modify theiroverall behavior. While considerable progress has been made inunderstanding and describing cohesive granular systems through idealizednumerical simulations, controlled experiments corroborating andexpanding the wide range of behavior remain challenging to perform. Inrecent years, various experimental approaches have been developed tocontrol inter-particle adhesion that now pave the way to further ourunderstanding of cohesive granular flows. This article reviews differentapproaches for making particles sticky, controlling their relativestickiness, and thereby studying their granular and bulk mechanics.

The recent discovery of p-type behavior in SeO2 hasstirred both interest and confusion in the scientific community. In thisLetter, we employ density functional theory calculations to unveil theintrinsic insulating characteristics of SeO2, highlighting substantialchallenges in carrier doping. Our electronic structure analyses indicatethat the Se 5s2 states are energetically positioned too low toeffectively interact with the O 2p orbitals, resulting in a valence bandmaximum (VBM) primarily dominated by the O 2p orbitals. The deep andlocalized nature of the VBM in SeO2 limits its potential as ahigh-mobility p-type TOS. Defect calculations demonstrate that allintrinsic defects in SeO2 exhibit deep transition levels within thebandgap. The Fermi level consistently resides in the mid-gap region,regardless of synthesis conditions. Furthermore, deep intrinsicacceptors and donors exhibit negative formation energies in the n-typeand p-type regions, respectively, facilitating their spontaneousformation and impeding external doping efforts. Thus, the reportedp-type conductivity in SeO2 samples is unlikely intrinsic and is moreplausibly attributed to reduced elemental Se, a well-known p-typesemiconductor.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10912"><em>arXiv:2501.10912</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="unveiling-an-in-plane-hall-effect-in-rutile-ruo_2-films">Unveilingan in-plane Hall effect in rutile RuO<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span> films</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+M">MengWang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+J">JianbingZhang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tian,+D">DiTian</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yu,+P">PuYu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kagawa,+F">FumitakaKagawa</a></span></p><p>The in-plane-magnetic-field-induced Hall effect (IPHE) observed inWeyl semimetals and PT-symmetric antiferromagnets has attractedincreasing attention, as it breaks the stereotype that the Hall effectis induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field or magnetization.

Although there exist cases where one typeof method works better than the other, it is desirable to find thepossible correlation between entanglement and average sign for generalhard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. Wetake the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example andnumerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement inthe ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and theaverage sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation atlow temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. Theentanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20%doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods.

The ohmic contacts tothe electron gas in these systems are accomplished by ion-implantationtechnique since the conventional Au/Sb alloyed contacts present a roughsurface consisting of sharp islands and pits. These sharp protrusionscause electrical discharge across the gate-dielectric between the ohmiccontacts and the accumulation-gates causing device break-down. A clearunderstanding of the surface morphology, elemental, compositional andelectrical characterization of the alloyed region would enable one toengineer a smoother post alloyed surface. In this work, we find that therough surface morphology is a cumulative effect of the Au/Si eutecticreaction and the threading dislocations inherent in the heterostructure.The structural, elemental, and chemical-state analysis show that theinverted pyramidal pits are resulting from the enhanced Au/Si eutecticreaction at the threading dislocations stemming from the heterostructureinterface, while, the sharp protrusions causing accumulationgate-leakage are gold-rich precipitations.

Ourfindings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitialsites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. Anintriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was alsoobserved and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induceunexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting,due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon theseobservations, we developed a robust method to systematically identifythe interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. Thisapproach combines site detection with structural filtering to producedistributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomisticsimulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this methodenabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies,significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system.Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomicpositions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitialsegregation energy.

Our approach is based onan analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping fromthe bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctionsare described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unitvectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacianmodel and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies thephase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguishbetween the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk andedge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitionsfrom delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes.

In recentyears, machine-learned potentials (MLPs), trained againstfirst-principles calculations, have become a new paradigm in materialsmodeling as they provide a desirable balance between accuracy andcomputational cost. The neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach,implemented in the open-source GPUMD software, has emerged as apromising machine-learned potential, exhibiting impressive accuracy andexceptional computational efficiency. This review provides acomprehensive discussion on the methodological and practical aspects ofthe NEP approach, along with a detailed comparison with otherrepresentative state-of-the-art MLP approaches in terms of trainingaccuracy, property prediction, and computational efficiency. We alsodemonstrate the application of the NEP approach to perform accurate andefficient MD simulations, addressing complex challenges that traditionalforce fields typically can not tackle. Key examples include structuralproperties of liquid and amorphous materials, chemical order in complexalloy systems, phase transitions, surface reconstruction, materialgrowth, primary radiation damage, fracture in two-dimensional materials,nanoscale tribology, and mechanical behavior of compositionally complexalloys under various mechanical loadings. This review concludes with asummary and perspectives on future extensions to further advance thisrapidly evolving field.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11191"><em>arXiv:2501.11191</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">43 pages, 28figures</span></p><h3id="control-of-ferroelectric-domain-wall-dynamics-by-point-defects-insights-from-ab-initio-based-simulations">Controlof ferroelectric domain wall dynamics by point defects: Insights from abinitio based simulations</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Teng,+S">Sheng-HanTeng</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dimou,+A">ArisDimou</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Udofia,+B">BenjaminUdofia</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ghasemi,+M">MajidGhasemi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Stricker,+M">MarkusStricker</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gr%C3%BCnebohm,+A">AnnaGrünebohm</a></span></p><p>The control of ferroelectric domain walls and their dynamics on thenanoscale becomes increasingly important for advanced nanoelectronicsand novel computing schemes. One common approach to tackle thischallenge is the pinning of walls by point defects. The fundamentalunderstanding on how different defects influence the wall dynamics is,however, incomplete. In particular, the important class of defectdipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently underrepresentedin theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular dynamicssimulations based on an -derived effective Hamiltonian and methods frommaterials informatics, and analyze the impact of these defects on themotion of 180<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> domain wallsin tetragonal BaTiO<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. We show howthese defects can act as local pinning centers and restoring forces onthe domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can flow aroundsparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and howpinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defectdistribution. Surprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants andwalls is short-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for thenucleation processes underlying wall motion is the defect-free area infront of the wall.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11193"><em>arXiv:2501.11193</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="metallicity-and-anomalous-hall-effect-in-epitaxially-strained-atomically-thin-ruo2-films">Metallicityand Anomalous Hall Effect in Epitaxially-Strained, Atomically-thin RuO2Films</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jeong,+S+G">SeungGyo Jeong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee,+S">SeungjunLee</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lin,+B">BonnieLin</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+Z">ZhifeiYang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Choi,+I+H">InHyeok Choi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Oh,+J+Y">JinYoung Oh</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Song,+S">SehwanSong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee,+S+w">Seungwook Lee</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Nair,+S">SreejithNair</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Choudhary,+R">RashmiChoudhary</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Parikh,+J">JuhiParikh</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Park,+S">SungkyunPark</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Choi,+W+S">WooSeok Choi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee,+J+S">JongSeok Lee</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=LeBeau,+J+M">JamesM.

To address this issue, we proposea deep learning-based approach using simulated images. Using densityfunctional theory calculations with a set of pseudo-atomic orbital basissets, we generate highly accurate ground truth images. We introduce fourtypes of noise into these simulations to create realistic trainingdatasets. Each type of noise is then used to train a separateconvolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our results show that theseCNNs are effective in reducing noise, even when applied to images withdifferent noise levels than those used during training. However, weobserve limitations in some cases, particularly in preserving theintegrity of circular shapes and avoiding visible artifacts betweenimage patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose alternativetraining strategies and future research directions.

Here, in thetemperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically propose theextrinsic phonon contribution to thermal Hall Effect in KSL via theskew-scattering of chiral phonons by the scalar spin chirality, whichwas previously studied in Mott insulators. We show the emergence of thescalar spin chirality of fluctuating spins, estimate the emergent fieldstrength and its symmetric form applied to the chiral phonons, andobtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity, which issemi-quantitatively consistent with the existing experiments. This workprovides a basic understanding of the role of spin-phonon interactionsin strongly correlated systems.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11272"><em>arXiv:2501.11272</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">22 pages, 4 figures, 1 TOCfigure</span></p><h3id="a-machine-learning-bond-order-potential-for-exploring-the-configuration-space-of-carbon">AMachine-Learning Bond-Order Potential for Exploring the ConfigurationSpace of Carbon</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kohata,+I">IkumaKohata</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hisama,+K">KaoruHisama</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Otsuka,+K">KeigoOtsuka</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Maruyama,+S">ShigeoMaruyama</a></span></p><p>Construction of transferable machine-learning interatomic potentialswith a minimal number of parameters is important for their generalapplicability.

For classical microscopic engines,explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherentinevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions ofthese results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases ofslow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-offrelation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finitetime, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. Byutilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probabilityrepresentations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicableto arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes.Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as theefficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which isstricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditionsunder which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power isachieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and thedifference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. Thesefindings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirmtheir applicability across various types of protocols for heat enginecycles.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11317"><em>arXiv:2501.11317</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Statistical Mechanics(cond-mat.stat-mech), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">7 pages, 3 figures</span></p><h3id="direct-ab-initio-calculation-of-magnons-in-altermagnets-method-spin-space-symmetry-aspects-and-application-to-mnte">Directab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-spacesymmetry aspects, and application to MnTe</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sandratskii,+L+M">L.M.

The method is based on thedensity-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints:one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect tothe ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsiblefor the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the methodis demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An importantrole in both the formulation and the application of the method play theaspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. Thesymmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following threeparts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetryof the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initiocalculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states inthe ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnonexcitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of theelectron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons haveidentical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since thealtermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Teatoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis andcalculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. Theknowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows toaccelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves asa test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connectionbetween electron band structures of the magnon states of the system andthe chirality properties of these states we investigate thetransformation of the electron structure in the transition from thecollinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11327"><em>arXiv:2501.11327</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)</span></p><h3 id="active-chemo-mechanical-solitons">Active chemo-mechanicalsolitons</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Truskinovsky,+L">LevTruskinovsky</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zurlo,+G">GiuseppeZurlo</a></span></p><p>In many biological systems localized mechanical information istransmitted by mechanically neutral chemical signals.

The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verifieddepends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it iscolumnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment ofnatural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or elsetime-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamicscaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specificuniversality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sinefunction (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior isthat of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type ofrandomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In allthe other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associatedwith the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces.Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture,however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine couplingpreserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetryare employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetryarguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types ofrandomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings)affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question bynumerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise andcolumnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidenceconfirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that setsapart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to theabsence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11432"><em>arXiv:2501.11432</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Statistical Mechanics(cond-mat.stat-mech), Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems(nlin.AO)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Submitted to Physica D(2025). 16 pages, 9 figures</span></p><h3id="stability-and-nucleation-of-dipole-strings-in-uniaxial-chiral-magnets">Stabilityand Nucleation of Dipole Strings in Uniaxial Chiral Magnets</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kuchkin,+V+M">VladyslavM.

Here, we show that, in uniaxial chiral magnets, anisolated DS remains stable in an unperturbed vacuum, thus representing atrue three-dimensional soliton. The phase diagram illustrates thestability of the DS embedded in the conical or helical phases across abroad range of material parameters and external magnetic fields.

We showthat their area dynamics can be described by a Langevin equation with aconstant negative drift and noise proportional to the perimeter, fullycharacterizing bubble area and lifetime statistics. Additionally, wedevelop a lattice gas model that captures the morphological properties,including the decrease in bubble asphericity with increasing area.

Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool forgrowing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality neededfor quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, weidentify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundredsof microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD.

However,the full potential of this technique remains largely unexploited due toits high demand on the X-ray source. Only a selected number ofinstruments at large-scale facilities can deliver the requiredshort-pulsed and wavelength-tunable radiation, renderinglaboratory-scale experiments elusive so far.

However, their predictive capabilities remain limitedbecause existing approaches struggle to accurately account for the fullcomplexities of redox reactions. Here, we develop a reactive-transportframework that leverages recent advancements in thermodynamic modelling,speciation chemistry, and redox kinetics. Distinct from traditionalmodels, we uniquely treat redox kinetics along with transport astransient phenomena, decoupled from Gibbs free energy minimisation.Ensuring ion concentrations are governed by non-equilibrium rate laws,this approach allows predicting the tempo-spatial distribution ofspeciation and precipitation of species across oxidation states.

Owing to their small thickness, lipidmembranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However,this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanicalbehavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this,we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to deriveeffective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipidmembranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law andthe electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theoryas <span class="math inline">\((2+\delta)\)</span>-dimensional, where<span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> indicates the membranethickness. However, the <spanclass="math inline">\((2+\delta)\)</span>-dimensional balance lawsderived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are requiredto specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we deviseappropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture thein-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. Theviscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluidmodel, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensionalmodels. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing afree energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise tothe characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs inits higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory.Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipidmembranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surfaceincompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally,we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations ofmotion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11612"><em>arXiv:2501.11612</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)</span></p><h3id="dynamics-of-local-photoconductivity-in-gaas-and-inp-investigated-by-thz-snom">Dynamicsof local photoconductivity in GaAs and InP investigated by THz SNOM</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Troha,+T">TinkaraTroha</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Singh,+A">ArvindSingh</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ku%C5%BEel,+P">PetrKužel</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=N%C4%9Bmec,+H">HynekNěmec</a></span></p><p>Terahertz scanning near-field optical microscope (THz-SNOM) isemployed to measure ultrafast evolution of THz conductivity spectraafter photoexcitation of GaAs and InP wafers using ultrashort laserpulses.

The mechanisms dominatingobserved energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on threesteps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link.First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directlysensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so thathigher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted inlarger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties canbe probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategyto mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricatedby shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scaledisorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spinstability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gatevoltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasingrates are comparable with the best devices previously reported,suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are notlinked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires.

Using scanning superconducting quantuminterference device (SQUID) microscopy, we performed local measurementsof the current distribution in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulatorat large bias currents, where the quantization of the conductivitytensor breaks down. We find that bulk currents in the channel interiorcoexist with edge currents at the sample boundary. While the position ofthe edge current changes with the reversal of the magnetic field, itdoes not depend on the current direction. To understand ourobservations, we introduce a model which includes contributions fromboth the sample magnetization and currents driven by chemical potentialgradients. To parameterize our model, we use local measurements of thechemical potential induced changes in the sample magnetization. Ourmodel reveals that the observed edge currents can be understood aschanges in the magnetization generated by the electrochemical potentialdistribution in the sample under bias. Our work underscores thecomplexity of electronic transport in MTIs and highlights both the valueand challenges of using magnetic imaging to disentangle variouscontributions to the electronic transport signatures.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11666"><em>arXiv:2501.11666</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Other Condensed Matter(cond-mat.other)</span></p><h3id="quantum-confining-excitons-with-electrostatic-moire-superlattice">Quantumconfining excitons with electrostatic moir'e superlattice</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gu,+L">LiuxinGu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+L">LifuZhang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Felsenfeld,+S">SamFelsenfeld</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ma,+R">RundongMa</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Park,+S">SujiPark</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jang,+H">HoukJang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Taniguchi,+T">TakashiTaniguchi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Watanabe,+K">KenjiWatanabe</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhou,+Y">YouZhou</a></span></p><p>Quantum confining excitons has been a persistent challenge in thepursuit of strong exciton interactions and quantum light generation.Unlike electrons, which can be readily controlled via electric fields,imposing strong nanoscale potentials on excitons to enable quantumconfinement has proven challenging. In this study, we utilizepiezoresponse force microscopy to image the domain structures of twistedhexagonal boron nitride (hBN), revealing evidence of strong in-planeelectric fields at the domain boundaries. By placing a monolayer MoSe2only one to two nanometers away from the twisted hBN interface, weobserve energy splitting of neutral excitons and Fermi polarons byseveral millielectronvolts at the moiré domain boundaries. By directlycorrelating local structural and optical properties, we attribute suchobservations to excitons confined in a nanoscale one-dimensionalelectrostatic potential created by the strong in-plane electric fieldsat the moiré domain boundaries. Intriguingly, this 1D quantumconfinement results in pronounced polarization anisotropy in theexcitons' reflection and emission, persistent to temperatures as high as~80 Kelvins.

Designing suchbiomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interactionbetween nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scalesof these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulationsoffer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This studypresents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanicalresponses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes tonanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical andcylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, weidentified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity,typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillartips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity,characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing atcontact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring athreefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillarheight and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greaterheights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increasedspacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model,representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enablescost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods.

Some of the most remarkable,especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phasetransformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspiredbrick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has,however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into asingle all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computationalmethodology for the design of a material that combines these twotoughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach thatcaptures both their individual contributions and the overall fractureperformance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic compositewith a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystallinemortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phasetransformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations,and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformationstress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortarconstitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of thetwo toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremelyeffective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of bricksize, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials isthen systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimizationalgorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and materialparameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortarthickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations ofmaterial properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortarthicknesses.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11728"><em>arXiv:2501.11728</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="quantum-geometric-spin--and-charge-josephson-diode-effects">Quantum-GeometricSpin- and Charge Josephson Diode Effects</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Schulz,+N+L">NiklasL.

This includesphenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wignercrystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems,two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they canhost electronic states with unique band structures, such asdispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In thiswork, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a classof 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on theeffects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. Thestudied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoreticframework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartitesquare and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures.In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands intoquasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. Bytuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergenceof directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably,all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating,semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight thepotential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulatingelectronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783"><em>arXiv:2501.11783</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con), Quantum Physics(quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Keywords: Flat bands,strongly correlated electrons, topological phase transitions, graphtheory, 2D materials</span></p><h3id="self-aligned-multilayered-nitrogen-vacancy-diamond-nanoparticles-for-high-spatial-resolution-magnetometry-of-microelectronic-currents">Self-alignedmultilayered nitrogen vacancy diamond nanoparticles for high spatialresolution magnetometry of microelectronic currents</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gokhale,+Y">YashGokhale</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Coventry,+B+S">BrandonS Coventry</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Rogers,+T">TsaniRogers</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lines,+M">MayaLines</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Vena,+A">AnnaVena</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Phillips,+J">JackPhillips</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhu,+T">TianxiangZhu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Bok,+I">IlhanBok</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Troche,+D+J">DarianaJ.

However, only a small number ofstudies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry beingthat spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned,precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared withexpensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layeringNVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitatesuperior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined withsimplified probe preparation.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the fundamental buildingblocks of graphene, have been documented to possess plasmonic propertiesthrough experimental observations, making them prime candidates forinvestigation. By doping different elements, the conjugated structure ofthe molecule can be altered. In this study, the plasmonic excitationproperties influenced by conjugated structures in peropyrene and itsderivatives are investigated through first-principles calculations thatcombine the plasmonicity index, generalized plasmonicity index andtransition contribution maps. For molecular plasmonic excitation, theconjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of valenceelectrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancementcharacteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degreeof alteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elementswill result in varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiatingdifferent trends in the evolution of plasmonic resonance. This furtherenhances the tunability of molecular plasmonic resonance. The resultsprovide novel insights into the development and utilization of molecularplasmonic devices in practical applications.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11802"><em>arXiv:2501.11802</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Optics (physics.optics)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">19 pages, 6figures</span></p><h3id="room-temperature-quantum-emission-from-mathrmcu_zn-mathrmv_s-defects-in-znscu-colloidal-nanocrystals">Room-temperaturequantum emission from <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}\)</span>-<spanclass="math inline">\(\mathrm{V_{S}}\)</span> defects in ZnS:Cucolloidal nanocrystals</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Panfil,+Y+E">YossefE.

However, the nature of glass transition remains farfrom being clarified. A key to understand the glass transition is toclarify what determines the glass transition temperature (Tg) and liquidfragility (m). Here the glass transition thermodynamics for 150different glass-forming systems are studied statistically. It is foundthat the activation characters in the energy landscape are crucial toprecisely portray the glass transition and, in particular, both theactivation free energy (G) and the activation entropy (S) play criticalroles. Gdetermines Tg, Tg=G/290+25.5, while Sdetermines m, m=S/Rln10+15with R is gas constant. Based on the Boltzmann definition of entropy,the fragility is an indication of the number of the degeneracy of theevolution paths. This explains why the nano-confined, low-dimension orhigh-pressured glasses exhibit stronger characteristics, which has beena puzzling phenomenon for a long time.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11857"><em>arXiv:2501.11857</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="development-of-an-uncertainty-aware-equation-of-state-for-gold">Developmentof an uncertainty-aware equation of state for gold</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+L+H">LinH.

Byintegrating Error-in-Variables (EIV) into the GP model, we adeptlynavigate uncertainties in both input parameters (like temperature anddensity) and output variables (including pressure and otherthermodynamic properties). Our methodology is demonstrated usingfirst-principles density functional theory (DFT) data for gold,observing its properties over maximum density compression (up to 100g/cc) and extreme temperatures within the warm dense matter region(reaching 300 eV).

With increasing rod packing,we identify nematic and solid phases and find that the nematic-crystalphase transition happens at a uniform packing fraction (<spanclass="math inline">\(\eta_c \approx 0.82\)</span>), independent of thespherocylinder aspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than thewell-known critical freezing transition of a hard disk fluid (<spanclass="math inline">\(\eta_c \approx 0.7\)</span>) to which one couldnaively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers.We attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientationalentropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory basedon a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of atwo-dimensional rod fluid. Introduction of electrostatic interactionsbetween the rods reduces the lateral compressibility of the monolayerfluid but keeps the positional order unhindered, which in turn maintainsthe packing fraction at the nematic-crystal transition. The strength ofthe orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranesexhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Ourfindings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystalphase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recentexperimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11952"><em>arXiv:2501.11952</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">10 pages, 9figures</span></p><h3 id="metamaterials-that-learn-to-change-shape">Metamaterials thatlearn to change shape</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Du,+Y">YaoDu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Veenstra,+J">JonasVeenstra</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=van+Mastrigt,+R">Ryanvan Mastrigt</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Coulais,+C">CorentinCoulais</a></span></p><p>Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation andevolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues andanimals.

Real-time time-dependent density functionaltheory (rt-TDDFT) has emerged as a powerful computational tool forsimulating these dynamics, offering insight into untrafast processes andlight-matter interactions. In periodic systems, the velocity gauge isessential because it preserves the system's periodicity under anexternal electric field. Numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) are widelyemployed in rt-TDDFT codes due to their efficiency and localized nature.However, directly applying the velocity gauge within the NAO basis setneglects the position-dependent phase variations within atomic orbitalsinduced by the vector potential, leading to significant computationalerrors-particularly in current calculations. To resolve this issue, wedevelop a hybrid gauge that incorporates both the electric field and thevector potential, preserving the essential phase information in atomicorbitals and thereby eliminating these errors. Our benchmark resultsdemonstrate that the hybrid gauge fully resolves the issues encounteredwith the velocity gauge in NAO-based calculations, providing accurateand reliable results. This algorithm offers a robust framework forfuture studies on ultrafast dynamics in periodic systems using NAObases.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11961"><em>arXiv:2501.11961</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="exploiting-the-presence-of-chiral-spin-states-in-molecular-nanomagnets">Exploitingthe presence of chiral spin states in molecular nanomagnets</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ullah,+A">AmanUllah</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hu,+Z">ZiqiHu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gaita-Ari%C3%B1o,+A">AlejandroGaita-Ariño</a></span></p><p>In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchangeinteractions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state withinthe doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality.

The growing of relevance of a:C-His mainly due to the long-term stability of their outstandingproperties. For improving their performances, a full understanding oftheir local chemistry is highly required. Fifteen years ago, electronenergy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), developed in a transmission electronmicroscope (TEM), was the technique of choice to extract such kind ofquantitative information on these materials. Other optical techniques,as Raman spectroscopy, are now clearly favored by the scientificcommunity. However, they still lack of the spatial resolution offered byTEM-EELS. In addition, nowadays, the complexity of the physics phenomenabehind EELS is better known. Here, a:C-H thin films have beenisothermally annealed and the evolution of their physical and chemicalparameters have been monitored at the local and macroscopic scales. Inparticular, chemical in-depth inhomogeneities and their origins arehighlighted. Furthermore, a novel procedure to extract properly andreliably quantitative chemical information from EEL spectra ispresented. Finally, the pertinence of empirical models used by the Ramancommunity is discussed. These works demonstrate the pertinence of thecombination of local and macroscopic analyses for a proper study of suchcomplex materials.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11973"><em>arXiv:2501.11973</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Carbon Volume 112, February2017, Pages 149-161 Volume 112, February 2017, Pages 149-161</span></p><h3id="unusual-magnetic-order-field-induced-melting-and-role-of-spin-lattice-coupling-in-2d-van-der-waals-materials-a-case-study-of-crsite3">Unusualmagnetic order, field induced melting and role of spin-lattice couplingin 2D Van der Waals materials: a case study of CrSiTe3</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gohil,+S">SmitaGohil</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Halder,+S">SaswataHalder</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Iyer,+K+K">KarthikK Iyer</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ghosh,+S">ShankarGhosh</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Thamizhavel,+A">A.Thamizhavel</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Maiti,+K">KalobaranMaiti</a></span></p><p>Two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals compounds exhibit interestingelectronic and magnetic properties due to complex intra-layer andinter-layer interactions, which are of immense importance in realizingexotic physics as well as advanced technology. Various experimental andtheoretical studies led to significantly different ground stateproperties often contrasting each other. Here, we studied a novel 2Dmaterial, CrSiTe3 employing magnetic, specific heat and Ramanmeasurements. Experimental results reveal evidence of incipientantiferromagnetism below 1 kOe concomitant to ferromagnetic order at 33K. Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions coexists at lowfield in the temperature regime, 15 - 33 K. Low field data reveal anadditional magnetic order below 15 K, which melts on application ofexternal magnetic field and remain dark in the heat capacity data. Ramanspectra exhibit anomalies at the magnetic transitions; an evidence ofstrong spin-lattice coupling. Below 15 K, Eg modes exhibit hardeningwhile Ag modes become significantly softer suggesting weakening of theinter-layer coupling at low temperatures which might be a reason for theunusual magnetic ground state and field induced melting of the magneticorder. These results reveal evidence of exceptional ground stateproperties linked to spin-lattice coupling and also suggest a pathway tostudy complex magnetism in such technologically important materials.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12019"><em>arXiv:2501.12019</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">6 figures</span></p><h3id="multiterminal-josephson-junctions-with-tunable-topological-properties">MultiterminalJosephson junctions with tunable topological properties</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ram,+P">PanchRam</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Beckmann,+D">DetlefBeckmann</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Danneau,+R">RomainDanneau</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Belzig,+W">WolfgangBelzig</a></span></p><p>Since the discovery of the Andreev reflection process atnormal-metal/superconductor junctions and the corresponding Andreevbound states in superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions,various multiterminal Josephson junctions have been studied to exploremany exotic phases of quantum matter, where the formation of Andreevbound states in the normal region account for dissipationlesssupercurrent and play a central role in determining exotic properties.Recently, an intriguing aspect of the multiterminal Josephson junctionshas been proposed to study the topological properties, wherein theAndreev bound states acquire topological characteristics upon tuning thephase differences of superconducting terminals.

They have recently gainedrecognition as promising candidates for soft actuators due to theirlightweight nature, noise-free operation, and low-driving voltages.However, the materials traditionally utilized to develop them are oftennot human/environmentally friendly. Thus, to address this issue,researchers have been focusing on developing biocompatible versions ofthis actuator. Despite this, such actuators still face challenges inachieving high performance, in payload capacity, bending capabilities,and response time. In this paper, we present a biocompatible ionicpolymer actuator whose membrane is fully 3D printed utilizing a directink writing method. The structure of the printed membranes consists ofbiodegradable ionic fluid encapsulated within layers of activated carbonpolymers. From the microscopic observations of its structure, weconfirmed that the ionic polymer is well encapsulated. The actuators canachieve a bending performance of up to 124<spanclass="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> (curvature of 0.82 <spanclass="math inline">\(\text{cm}^{-1}\)</span>), which, to our knowledge,is the highest curvature attained by any bending ionic polymer actuatorto date.

Our results showcase apromising, high-performing biocompatible ionic polymer actuator, whosemembrane can be easily manufactured in a single step using a standardFDM 3D printer.

While Raman spectra can be obtained theoreticallyfrom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculationof the electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory.First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability arecomputationally expensive, motivating the development of atomisticmodels for the evaluation of the changes in the electronicpolarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system.The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplestsuch atomistic models, but cannot reproduce the effects of angularvibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, wedemonstrate that the generalization of BPM through inclusion of termsfor atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved inbonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modelingand Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproducesthe ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of testedmolecules (SO2, H2S, H2O, NH3, CH4, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH) with highaccuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initioresults for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO3 systems. For liquidwater, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MDsimulations using GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantlyimproved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to thespectrum derived using BPM. Thus, GBPM can be used for the modeling ofRaman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a goodbasis for the further development of atomistic polarizabilitymodels.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12059"><em>arXiv:2501.12059</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="exploring-the-limits-of-superconductivity-in-metal-stuffed-b-c-clathrates-via-ionic-lattice-anharmonicity">Exploringthe Limits of Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates viaIonic Lattice Anharmonicity</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-2220:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhao,+W">WenboZhao</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sun,+Y">YingSun</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+J">JiaxiangLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yuan,+P">PengYuan</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Iitaka,+T">ToshiakiIitaka</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhong,+X">XinZhong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+H">HefeiLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Fang,+Y">Yue-WenFang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Liu,+H">HanyuLiu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Errea,+I">IonErrea</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xie,+Y">YuXie</a></span></p><p>Metal-stuffed B-C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure havecaptured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptionalsuperconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure.However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existingstudies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweightsystem.

It is found that a 9% strain along [001] directionenhances thermal conductivity sixfold. The underlying mechanisms areanalyzed through vibrational density of states, spectral energydensities, and mean square displacements.

Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau'sFermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3Dmetals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to aeven broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After acertain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power hasnow been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms.They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires,topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms,Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries andspin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuationsbecome correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, nolong-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustratethe validity of conformal field theory for describing real-worldsystems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on theother side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how thequantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systemsin one dimension.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12097"><em>arXiv:2501.12097</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall),Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Brief review ofTomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics and its experimental realizations.Comments and suggestions welcome.

Its chirality and strength are determined by theproperties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation atthe interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the chirality of the DMI canchange solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagneticlayer - an effect that has not been experimentally observed or explaineduntil now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer systemTa/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal thatvariations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at theinterface, driven by the number of ferromagnetic atomic layers, lead toan inversion of DMI chirality. This mechanism takes place forferromagnetic layers with more than three atomic layers, for which thetwo interfaces start to be decoupled. We hence propose a new degree offreedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures bytailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acousticwaves.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12098"><em>arXiv:2501.12098</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">5 figures + supplementarymaterials</span></p><h3id="quantum-trajectories-and-page-curve-entanglement-dynamics">Quantumtrajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics</h3><p>New Submission | Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) |2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ganguly,+K">KathaGanguly</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gopalakrishnan,+P">PreethiGopalakrishnan</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Naik,+A">AtharvaNaik</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Agarwalla,+B+K">BijayKumar Agarwalla</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kulkarni,+M">ManasKulkarni</a></span></p><p>We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filledfermionic system and an empty reservoir.

By combining Floquet theory withparticle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robustMajorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands withopposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weaknon-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving atopological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time (<spanclass="math inline">\(\mathcal{PT}\)</span>) symmetry.

The probe photon energy istuned to the exciton resonance, while the pump photon energy is detunedfrom it up to 0.75 eV to higher energies. The spin-oriented electronsand holes photogenerated with significant excess kinetic energy relaxinto states in vicinity of the band gap, where they undergo Larmorprecession in an external magnetic field. At cryogenic temperatures downto 1.6 K, the spin dephasing time reaches the nanosecond range. Duringenergy relaxation, the carrier spin relaxation is inefficient and onlyhappens when the carriers become localized. In experiments with two pumppulses, all-optical control of the amplitudes and phases of the electronand hole spin signals is achieved in the additive regime by varying theintensities of the pump pulses and the time delay between them.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12159"><em>arXiv:2501.12159</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="non-hermitian-wave-packet-dynamics-and-its-realization-within-a-non-hermitian-chiral-cavity">Non-Hermitianwave-packet dynamics and its realization within a non-Hermitian chiralcavity</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dong,+W">WeicenDong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jiang,+Q">Qing-DongJiang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Baggioli,+M">MatteoBaggioli</a></span></p><p>Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework forstudying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extendingthis approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents severalimportant challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berryphase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}\)</span> symmetry isbroken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition usingthe bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations ofmotion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system.Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces bothan anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM.To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane modelfeaturing non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where theimbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent`complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components ofthe complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginaryparts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction anddissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings areconfirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics.Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complexHaldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing apromising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12163"><em>arXiv:2501.12163</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">v1: comments arewelcome!</span></p><h3id="mesoscopic-collective-dynamics-in-liquids-and-the-dual-model">MesoscopicCollective Dynamics in Liquids and the Dual Model</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-22 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Peluso,+F">FabioPeluso</a></span></p><p>A microscopic vision is presented of a Dual Model of Liquids from asolid picture.

In symmetry-enforcedNLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust toarbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. Weinvestigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recentlyproposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Usingmean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show thatthe Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-fillingexhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagneticphase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction <spanclass="math inline">\(U\)</span>. In contrast to thesemi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, whichoccurs at a finite critical value of <spanclass="math inline">\(U\)</span>, in the depleted lattice, thetransition at <span class="math inline">\(U=0\)</span> is associatedwith a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidentalnodal lines enforced by symmetry.

By leveraging insights from the Ising model and incorporatingconsiderations of topological defects, the transition to the glassystate in rod-like molecular systems in the supercooled state isexamined. Through a critical-like analysis of the system's dynamicalproperties, universality classes directly linked to symmetry arediscerned. This paper delves into the role of symmetry in the glasstransition, as manifested in the generalized critical relation ofconfigurational entropy <spanclass="math inline">\(S_C(T)=S_0(1-T_K/T)^n\)</span>, where the criticalexponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is intricately tied tothe system's symmetry. The determined values of the pseudocriticalexponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> exhibit universalityacross the studied systems and demonstrate excellent agreement withthermodynamic data. Furthermore, the congruence between the dynamicrepresentation, as indicated by the primary relaxation time, and thethermodynamic representation, exemplified by the specific heat capacity,underscores the robustness of the findings. The identification ofcritical-like behavior and the observation of symmetry breaking duringthe transition to the glass state suggest its intrinsic thermodynamicnature.

Through precise manipulation of these atoms by scanningtunneling microscopy, we can experimentally create all such magneticphases. Their different magnetic character is confirmed by densityfunctional theory and mean-field Hubbard calculations. In particular, weshow that the new magnetic paradigm known as altermagnetism can berealized, exhibiting directionally spin-split energy bands coexistingwith zero net magnetization due to protecting spatial symmetries. It isfurthermore possible to create fully compensated ferrimagnets, lackingthese symmetries and therefore presenting unrestricted spin splitting ofthe bands, with a vanishing net magnetization which in this case isprotected by Lieb's theorem.

The direct partialoxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates under mildconditions<sup>1-3</sup> is an attractive pathway, but the molecule'sinertness makes it challenging to achieve simultaneously high conversionand high selectivity towards a single target product. This difficulty isamplified when aiming for more valuable products that require C-Ccoupling<sup>4,5</sup>. While selective partial methane oxidationprocesses<sup>1-3,6-9</sup> have thus typically generated C<sub>1</sub>oxygenates<sup>6,7</sup>, recent reports have documented photocatalyticmethane conversion to the C<sub>2</sub> oxygenate ethanol with lowconversions but good to high selectivities<sup>4,5,8-12</sup>. Here, weshow that the intramolecular junction photocatalyst CTF-1 withalternating benzene and triazine motifs<sup>7,13</sup> drives methanecoupling and oxidation to ethanol with a high selectivity and muchimproved conversion. The heterojunction architecture not only enablesefficient and long-lived separation of charges after their generation,but also preferential adsorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> tothe triazine and benzene units, respectively. This dual-site featureseparates C-C coupling to form ethane intermediates from the sites where•OH radicals are formed and thereby avoids overoxidation. When loadedwith Pt to boost performance further, the molecular heterojunctionphotocatalyst generates ethanol in a packed-bed flow reactor withimproved conversion that results in an apparent quantum efficiency of9.4%. We anticipate that further developing the "intramolecularjunction" approach will deliver efficient and selective catalysts forC-C coupling, pertaining, but not limited, to methane conversion toC<sub>2+</sub> chemicals.</p><p><ahref="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08630-x"><i>Nature</i>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Catalytic mechanisms, Naturalgas, Photocatalysis</span></p><h2 id="nature-materials">Nature Materials</h2><h3id="revitalizing-interphase-in-all-solid-state-li-metal-batteries-by-electrophile-reduction">Revitalizinginterphase in all-solid-state Li metal batteries by electrophilereduction</h3><p>Original Paper | Batteries | 2025-01-19 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Weiran Zhang, Zeyi Wang,Hongli Wan, Ai-Min Li, Yijie Liu, Sz-Chian Liou, Kai Zhang, Yuxun Ren,Chamithri Jayawardana, Brett L.

However, increasing the activelayer thickness typically leads to a marked drop in the power conversionefficiency. Here we developed an organic semiconductor regulator, calledAT-β2O, to tune the crystallization sequence of the components in activelayers. When adding AT-β2O in the donor (D18-Cl) and acceptor (N3)blend, N3 crystallizes behind D18-Cl, and this phenomenon is differentfrom the co-crystallization observed in binary D18-Cl:N3 blends. Thismanipulation of crystallization dynamics is favourable to formbulk-heterojunction-gradient vertical phase separation in the activelayer accompanied by the high crystallinity of the acceptor and balancedcharge carrier mobilities in thick films. The resultant single-junctionorganic solar cells exhibited a certified power conversion efficiency ofover 20%, as well as demonstrated exceptional adaptability across theactive layer thicknesses (100-400 nm) and remarkable universality. Suchbreakthroughs enable large-area modules with a certified powerconversion efficiency of 18.04%.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-02062-0"><i>Nat.Mater.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Green photonics, Solarcells</span></p><h3id="stretch-induced-endogenous-electric-fields-drive-directed-collective-cell-migration-in-vivo">Stretch-inducedendogenous electric fields drive directed collective cell migration invivo</h3><p>Original Paper | Collective cell migration | 2025-01-16 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Fernando Ferreira, SofiaMoreira, Min Zhao, Elias H.

It was suggestedthat a phase transition in one dimension can occur in the presence oflong-range interactions. However, an experimental realization has so farnot been achieved due to the requirement to both realize interactionsover sufficiently long distances and to prepare equilibrium states. Herewe demonstrate a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension byimplementing a long-range interacting model in a trapped-ion quantumsimulator. We show that finite-energy states can be generated bytime-evolving initial product states and letting them thermalize underthe dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian. By preparing initial stateswith different energies, we study the finite-energy phase diagram of along-range interacting quantum system. We observe a ferromagneticequilibrium phase transition as well as a crossover from a low-energypolarized paramagnet to a high-energy unpolarized paramagnet, inagreement with numerical simulations.

We performed single-cell RNAsequencing of immune and tumor cells from 33 gliomas, identifying twodistinct myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations inisocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type (IDT-WT) glioblastoma: an earlyprogenitor MDSC (E-MDSC) population with up-regulation of metabolic andhypoxia pathways and a monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) population. Spatialtranscriptomics demonstrated that E-MDSCs geographically colocalize withmetabolic stem-like tumor cells in the pseudopalisading region.Ligand-receptor analysis revealed cross-talk between these cells, whereglioma stem-like cells produce chemokines attracting E-MDSCs, which inturn produce growth factors for the tumor cells. This interaction isabsent in IDH-mutant gliomas, associated with hypermethylation andrepressed gene expression of MDSC-attracting chemokines. Our studyelucidates specific MDSCs that may facilitate glioblastoma progressionand mediate tumor immunosuppression.</p><p><ahref="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abm5214?af=R"><em>Science</em><strong>387</strong>, eabm5214 (2025)</a></p><h3id="neuronal-ilc2-interactions-regulate-pancreatic-glucagon-and-glucose-homeostasis">Neuronal-ILC2interactions regulate pancreatic glucagon and glucose homeostasis</h3><p>Research Article | Tissue immunology | 2025-01-17 03:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Marko Šestan, Bruno Raposo,Miguel Rendas, David Brea, Roksana Pirzgalska, Ana Rasteiro, MariaAliseychik, Inês Godinho, Hélder Ribeiro, Tania Carvalho, StephanWueest, Daniel Konrad, Henrique Veiga-Fernandes</span></p><p>The immune system shapes body metabolism, while interactions betweenperipheral neurons and immune cells control tissue homeostasis andimmunity.

CanonicalSLs act as signals to microbes and plants, whereas noncanonical SLs areprimarily plant hormones. The cytochrome P450 CYP722C catalyzes acritical step, converting CLA to canonical SLs in most angiosperms.Using synthetic biology, we investigated the function of <i>CYP722A</i>,an evolutionary predecessor of <i>CYP722C</i>. CYP722A converts CLA into16-hydroxy-CLA (16-OH-CLA), a noncanonical SL detected exclusively inthe shoots of various flowering plants. 16-OH-CLA application restorescontrol of shoot branching to SL-deficient mutants in <i>Arabidopsisthaliana</i> and is perceived by the SL signaling pathway.

Specifically, we generalize Ulam's matrix approximationof the Perron-Frobenius operator, giving rise to conditionally invariantmeasures of various decay rates. There are many matrix approximationsleading to the same decay rate and we conjecture a criterion forselecting the one relevant for resonance states.

Despite its potential, MCG has faced obstacles suchas low efficiency and a high threshold photon energy at least twice theband gap (<span class="math inline">\(2{E}_{g}\)</span>) of thesemiconductor, limiting its application only to a class of materialswith low <span class="math inline">\({E}_{g}\)</span>. Here, we presenta new approach that overcomes this limitation by leveragingcarrier-donor scattering to excite secondary electrons from donor statesstrategically positioned below the conduction band. Our method relies onstrong Coulomb interaction, reduced dielectric screening, slow hotcarrier cooling, and strictly follows the energy conservation rules. Weexperimentally demonstrated this idea in a model system of monolayer(1L) <span class="math inline">\({\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}\)</span> byexploiting electron-donating chalcogen vacancy states. We observed anexceptionally low MCG threshold of <span class="math inline">\(\sim1.12{E}_{g}\)</span> for the first time in 1L <spanclass="math inline">\({\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}\)</span>.

Here, we presentMatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materialsacross the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer thegeneration towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared toprior generative models <sup>4,12</sup>, structures produced byMatterGen are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and morethan 10 times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning,MatterGen successfully generates stable, novel materials with desiredchemistry, symmetry, as well as mechanical, electronic and magneticproperties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generatedstructures and measure its property value to be within 20 % of ourtarget. We believe that the quality of generated materials and thebreadth of MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancementtowards creating a foundational generative model for materialsdesign.</p><p><ahref="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08628-5"><i>Nature</i>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Computer science, Theory andcomputation</span></p><h3id="brain-wide-neuronal-circuit-connectome-of-human-glioblastoma">Brain-wideneuronal circuit connectome of human glioblastoma</h3><p>Original Paper | Cancer in the nervous system | 2025-01-15 19:00EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Yusha Sun, Xin Wang, DanielY.

The extent of GBM integration into thebrain-wide neuronal circuitry remains unclear. Here we applied rabiesvirus- and herpes simplex virus-mediated trans-monosynaptictracing<sup>5,6</sup> to systematically investigate circuit integrationof human GBM organoids transplanted into adult mice. We found that GBMcells from multiple patients rapidly integrate into diverse local andlong-range neural circuits across the brain. Beyond glutamatergicinputs, we identified various neuromodulatory inputs, including synapsesbetween basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and GBM cells. Acuteacetylcholine stimulation induces long-lasting elevation of calciumoscillations and transcriptional reprogramming of GBM cells into a moremotile state via the metabotropic CHRM3 receptor. CHRM3 activationpromotes GBM cell motility, whereas its downregulation suppresses GBMcell motility and prolongs mouse survival. Together, these resultsreveal the striking capacity for human GBM cells to rapidly and robustlyintegrate into anatomically diverse neuronal networks of differentneurotransmitter systems. Our findings further support a model whereinrapid connectivity and transient activation of upstream neurons may leadto a long-lasting increase in tumor fitness.</p><p><ahref="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08634-7"><i>Nature</i>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Cancer in the nervous system,CNS cancer</span></p><h2 id="nature-nanotechnology">Nature Nanotechnology</h2><h3id="dipolar-wavevector-interference-induces-a-polar-skyrmion-lattice-in-strained-bifeo3-films">Dipolarwavevector interference induces a polar skyrmion lattice in strainedBiFeO3 films</h3><p>Original Paper | Ferroelectrics and multiferroics | 2025-01-15 19:00EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">W.

However,typical decoherence noise disrupts the volume-law phase, complicatingthe observation of the MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations caneffectively protect the MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enablingits detection in experiment. The transition is characterized byconditional entanglement entropy, which is associated with a statisticalmechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act ascompeting external random fields. When the net external field is zero, aferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting inthe MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an averageapparatus-environment symmetry, making conditional entanglement entropya valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as agenuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we providenumerical results that demonstrate the MIPT in a (<spanclass="math inline">\(2+1\)</span>)-dimensional quantum circuit underdephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate,enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally andensuring the feasibility of our protocol.

They can be used to encode error-correctablelogical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variablestates in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. Forexample, high-dimensional systems can be used to realize ‘Schrödingercat' states, which are superpositions of widely displaced coherentstates that can be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales.Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomicnuclei, which are finite-dimensional systems that can hosthardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here wedemonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrödinger cat statesusing the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a siliconnanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme toproduce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and weconstitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in theSchrödinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare andcontrol non-classical resource states, which is a prerequisite forapplications in quantum information processing and quantum errorcorrection, using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductorplatform.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02745-0"><i>Nat.Phys.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Quantum information,Qubits</span></p><h3 id="observation-of-joule-thomson-photon-gas-expansion">Observationof Joule-Thomson photon-gas expansion</h3><p>Original Paper | Nonlinear optics | 2025-01-13 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Marco S.

These developments now allow consideration of a series oflong-standing problems in optics, including the prospect of funnellingthe entire power flowing in a multimode system into its ground state,for which no methodology currently exists. Here we demonstrate anall-optical Joule-Thomson expansion process mediated by photon-photoninteractions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptlyto zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicorenonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoingexpansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input statesinto the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that thestability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversibleprocess of energy conversion.

In thermalequilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holdsat arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-rangeinteractions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, <spanclass="math inline">\({r}^{- \alpha }\)</span> (<spanclass="math inline">\(r\)</span>: distance), conditions for the thermalarea law are elusive. In this Letter, we aim to clarify the optimalcondition <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &gt;{\alpha }_{c}\)</span>such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach toconsidering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundaryinteraction between two subsystems. However, we find here that thethermal area law is more robust than this conventional argumentsuggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by<span class="math inline">\({\alpha }_{c}=(D+1)/2\)</span> (<spanclass="math inline">\(D\)</span>: the spatial dimension of the lattice),assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartitecorrelations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even thethermodynamically unstable regimes <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&lt;D\)</span>. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it isqualitatively accurate for both integrable and nonintegrable systems.Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developingthe power-law clustering theorem for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&gt;D\)</span> above a threshold temperature.

Each of the two latticecharges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally onoperators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do notcommute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but theircommutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly ismatched by this non-Abelian algebra, which is consistent with theNielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of thesetwo conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless,reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuousglobal symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, thesetwo charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flowto the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal fieldtheory.</p><p><ahref="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.021601"><em>Phys.Rev.

In van der Waalsantiferromagnets, a new type of magnetic polymorphism arises, presentingmultiple layer-selective magnetic structures with identical totalmagnetization. However, resolving and manipulating such magneticpolymorphs remain challenging. Here, phase-resolved magnetic secondharmonic generation microscopy is used to elucidate magneticpolymorphism in 2D layered antiferromagnet CrSBr, demonstratingdeterministic and layer-selective switching of magnetic polymorphs.Using a nonlinear magneto-optical technique, we unambiguously resolvethe polymorphic spin-flip transitions in CrSBr bilayers and tetralayersthrough both the amplitude and phase of light. Remarkably, thedeterministic routing of polymorphic spin-flip transitions originatesfrom a ‘layer-sharing' effect, where the transitions are governed bylaterally extended layers acting as ‘control bits'. We envision thatsuch controllable magnetic polymorphism could be ubiquitous for van derWaals layered antiferromagnets, enabling new designs and constructionsof spintronic and opto-spintronic devices for probabilistic computationand neuromorphic engineering.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-02074-w"><i>Nat.Mater.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Magnetic properties andmaterials, Magneto-optics, Nonlinear optics, Spintronics,Two-dimensional materials</span></p><h3id="morphology-remodelling-and-membrane-channel-formation-in-synthetic-cells-via-reconfigurable-dna-nanorafts">Morphologyremodelling and membrane channel formation in synthetic cells viareconfigurable DNA nanorafts</h3><p>Original Paper | DNA nanostructures | 2025-01-12 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Sisi Fan, Shuo Wang,Longjiang Ding, Thomas Speck, Hao Yan, Stephan Nussberger, NaLiu</span></p><p>The shape of biological matter is central to cell function atdifferent length scales and determines how cellular componentsrecognize, interact and respond to one another.

Helical excitations on quantized vortices,referred to as Kelvin waves, are one example of such a physical system.Kelvin waves play a vital role in energy dissipation within inviscidquantum fluids. However, deliberately exciting Kelvin waves has provento be challenging. Here we introduce a controlled method for excitingKelvin waves on a quantized vortex in superfluid helium-4. We used acharged nanoparticle that oscillates when driven by a time-varyingelectric field to stimulate Kelvin waves on the vortex. Confirmation ofthe helical nature of Kelvin waves was achieved throughthree-dimensional image reconstruction, which provided visual evidenceof their complex dynamics. Additionally, we determined the dispersionrelation and the phase velocity of the Kelvin wave and identified thevorticity direction, thus enhancing our understanding of quantum fluidbehaviour. This work elucidates the dynamics of Kelvin waves andinitiates an approach for manipulating and observing quantized vorticesin three dimensions, thereby opening avenues for exploring quantumfluidic systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02720-9"><i>Nat.Phys.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Bose-Einstein condensates,Fluid dynamics, Quantum fluids and solids</span></p><h3id="confinement-in-a-mathbbz_2-lattice-gauge-theory-on-a-quantum-computer">Confinementin a <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{Z}}_{2}\)</span> lattice gaugetheory on a quantum computer</h3><p>Original Paper | Nuclear physics | 2025-01-12 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Julius Mildenberger, WojciechMruczkiewicz, Jad C.

The constituents of gauge theories, for example, charged matterand electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, whichlead to key phenomena such as the confinement of particles that are notfully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may addressquestions that are challenging for classical methods. Althoughengineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances inquantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations ofgauge theories. Here we simulate confinement dynamics in a <spanclass="math inline">\({\mathbb{Z}}_{2}\)</span> lattice gauge theory ona superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only tothe electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation ofthe tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both.Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from <spanclass="math inline">\({\mathbb{Z}}_{2}\)</span> towards U(1) symmetryfreezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction thatthe underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a latticegauge theory, showcases how gauge constraints can be modified andprotected, and promotes the study of other models governed by multibodyinteractions.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02723-6"><i>Nat.Phys.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Nuclear physics, Quantumphysics, Quantum simulation</span></p><h2 id="physical-review-letters">Physical Review Letters</h2><h3 id="role-of-quantum-coherence-in-kinetic-uncertainty-relations">Roleof Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</h3><p>Research article | Fluctuations &amp; noise | 2025-01-13 05:00EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Kacper Prech, Patrick P.Potts, and Gabriel T.

This bound was derived in aclassical context and can be violated in the quantum regime due tocoherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violationsand quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significantinvestigation. In this Letter, we solve this problem by deriving amodified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence mightlead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind ofunraveling of the quantum master equation. It, therefore, allows one tocompare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in eachcase, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate ourresult on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitoredeither by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive chargemeasurement.</p><p><ahref="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.020401"><em>Phys.Rev.

We find that thesesuspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively lowconcentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-definedtransition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak inthe static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down anddevelop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. Thislow-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light ofexperiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar compositionthe interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to proposethat the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as anentropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled tocrowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as thenonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow. Ourwork suggests that similar effects might be a generic feature of dense,highly polydisperse charged suspensions.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04758"><em>arXiv:2501.04758</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">14 Pages with appendix. 6figures in the main text + 10 figures in the appendix</span></p><h3id="phase-diagram-confining-strings-and-a-new-universality-class-in-nematopolar-matter">Phasediagram, confining strings, and a new universality class in nematopolarmatter</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Vafa,+F">FarzanVafa</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Doostmohammadi,+A">AminDoostmohammadi</a></span></p><p>We study a minimal model of a system with coexisting nematic andpolar orientational orders, where one field tends to order and the otherprefers isotropy.

At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unitcell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levelsthat reflect its recursive construction. For most materials,Hofstadter's butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions thatare unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields. More recently,electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter'sbutterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large latticeconstants, such as those with moiré superlattices. Yet to-date, directspectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadternearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we usehigh-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM / STS)to probe the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene near thepredicted second magic angle, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studiesof Hofstadter's spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flatmoiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimentalsignatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, ourmeasurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electrondensity, displaying phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter's original modeldue to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulombinteractions, and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in twisted bilayergraphene.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04777"><em>arXiv:2501.04777</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">20 pages, 5figures</span></p><h3 id="a-phase-field-model-for-dna-self-assembly">A phase-field modelfor DNA self-assembly</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Cappa,+M">MarcoCappa</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sciortino,+F">FrancescoSciortino</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Rovigatti,+L">LorenzoRovigatti</a></span></p><p>We present a phase-field model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation toinvestigate the kinetics of phase separation in DNA nanostar systems.Leveraging a realistic free-energy functional derived from Wertheimtheory, our model captures the thermodynamic and dynamic properties ofself-assembling DNA nanostars under various conditions.

These new metrics provide a theoretical upper boundon CO2 captured per energy as well as a theoretical upper limit on thepurity of the captured CO2. These new metrics are based entirely onintrinsic material properties and are therefore agnostic to the designof the DAC system. These metrics apply to any adsorption-refresh cycledesign. In this work we demonstrate the use of these metrics with theexample of temperature-pressure swing refresh cycles. The mainrequirement for applying these metrics is to describe the equilibriumuptake (along with a few other materials properties) of each species interms of the thermodynamic variables (e.g. temperature, pressure). Wederive these metrics from thermodynamic energy balances. To apply thesemetrics on a set of examples, we first generated approximations of thenecessary materials properties for 11 660 metal-organic frameworkmaterials (MOFs). We find that the performance of the sorbents is highlydependent on the path through thermodynamic parameter space. Thesemetrics allow for: 1) finding the optimum materials given a particularrefresh cycle, and 2) finding the optimum refresh cycles given aparticular sorbent. Applying these metrics to the database of MOFs leadto the following insights: 1) start cold - the equilibrium uptake of CO2diverges from that of N2 at lower temperatures, and 2) selectivity ofCO2 vs other gases at any one point in the cycle does not matter - whatmatters is the relative change in uptake along the cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04825"><em>arXiv:2501.04825</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="training-allostery-inspired-mechanical-response-in-disordered-elastic-networks">TrainingAllostery-Inspired Mechanical Response in Disordered ElasticNetworks</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gowen,+S+D">SavannahD.

Using an active liquid crystalmodel, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to studythe growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active andelastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile andcontractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presentedin terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillarystresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids.

Important insights of such interactionscome from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins,orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role indetermining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a keytuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through externalperturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction hasshown great potential in controlling the couplings of collectiveexcitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolvedtechniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced ourunderstanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulatingthe dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims tohighlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations inthe time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between differentcollective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton,magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce howthese collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse andprobed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how thecoupling between collective excitations governs the ensuingnonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on futurestudies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergentproperties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05028"><em>arXiv:2501.05028</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall),Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="finite-strain-continuum-phenomenological-model-describing-the-shape-memory-effects-in-multi-phase-semi-crystalline-networks">Finitestrain continuum phenomenological model describing the shape-memoryeffects in multi-phase semi-crystalline networks</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Arricca,+M">MatteoArricca</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Inverardi,+N">NicolettaInverardi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Pandini,+S">StefanoPandini</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Toselli,+M">MaurizioToselli</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Messori,+M">MassimoMessori</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Scalet,+G">GiuliaScalet</a></span></p><p>Thermally-driven semi-crystalline polymer networks are capable toachieve both the one-way shape-memory effect and two-way shape-memoryeffect under stress and stress-free conditions, therefore representingan appealing class of polymers for applications requiring autonomousreversible actuation and shape changes. In these materials, theshape-memory effects are achieved by leveraging the synergisticinteraction between one or more crystalline phases and the surroundingamorphous ones that are present within the network itself. The presentpaper introduces a general framework for the finite strain continuumphenomenological modeling of the thermo-mechanical and shape-memorybehavior of multi-phase semi-crystalline polymer networks. Modelformulation, including the definition of phase and control variables,kinematic assumptions, and constitutive specifications, is introducedand thoroughly discussed. Theoretical derivations are general and easilyadaptable to all cross-linked systems which include two or morecrystalline domains or a single crystalline phase with a wide meltingrange and manifest macroscopically the one-way shape-memory effect andthe two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions.Model capabilities are validated against experimental data for copolymernetworks with two different crystalline phases characterized bywell-separated melting and crystallization transitions.

It has been found thatthe magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through thesimultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, themagnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by theformation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co andFe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we havedetermined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chainsconsisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactorshave been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximationof transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of theseprefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significantand non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitativelydescribes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers andthe frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from ourtheoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results ofnumerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimationof the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths,temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposedtheoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains onthe Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensionalmagnetic systems.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05047"><em>arXiv:2501.05047</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall), Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech),Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table,89 references</span></p><h3id="charge-transport-limited-by-nonlocal-electron-phonon-interaction.-i.-hierarchical-equations-of-motion-approach">Chargetransport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction.

It reveals that theauxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced bygenuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlationsare subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem.Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOMmethod featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute thenumerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within theone-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderatetemperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas hightemperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of thephonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. Thepronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the rangeof applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate tohigh temperatures, and not too fast phonons.

These features can be understood within approaches relying onthe timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such asthe transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them fromfully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchicalequations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper,we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near theadiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics verywell at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, thetransport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from thesubdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the bandcurrent dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevantfor transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that thesuper-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusivemotion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phononperiods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibitsa dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequencypeak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS,and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classicalsimulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM andTLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density ofstates.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055"><em>arXiv:2501.05055</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall),Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph), Quantum Physics(quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Main text: 13 pages, 4figures; Supplemental material: 7 pages, 4 figures; This submission isaccompanied by Part I.

The solution to this dilemma is related tounderstanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practicalimplications for the state of museum artefacts made of plasticisedpoly(vinyl chloride) - PVC and objects stored in their vicinity. Theconsequences of this process encompass aesthetic changes due to thepresence of exudates and dust deposition, an increase in air pollutionand the development of mechanical stresses. Therefore, this paperdiscusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to provide evidence andsupport the development of recommendations and guidelines forconservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly,the investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalatesrepresenting the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVCcollections. The predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission(evaporation) determining the rate-limiting step of the overallmigration process is considered a fundament for understanding thepotential environmental and mechanical risk. According to this concept,general correlations for various ortho-phthalates are proposed dependingon their molar mass with the support of molecular dynamics simulationsand NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for the majority of the PVCobjects in collections, the risk of accelerated migration upon mildremoval of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus, surface cleaningwould allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution byphthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mindsimplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, thestep-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification andquantification of plasticisers in objects made of or containingplasticised PVC, determination of the physical state of investigatedartefacts and rate-limiting process of plasticiser migration isproposed.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05090"><em>arXiv:2501.05090</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Preprint.

Their role as robust information carriers has alsogenerated much attention. However, controlling their motion remainschallenging, especially towards achieving motion along well-definedpaths which typically require predefined structural patterning. Here wedemonstrate the tunable, unidirectional motion of topological defects,specifically magnetic dislocations in a weak magnetic stripe pattern,induced by external magnetic field in a laterally unconfined thin film.This motion is shown to mediate the overall continuous rotation of thestripe pattern. We determine the connection between the unidirectionalmotion of dislocations and the underlying three-dimensional (3D)magnetic structure by performing 3D magnetic vectorial imaging with insitu magnetic fields. A minimal model for dislocations in stripepatterns that encodes the symmetry breaking induced by the externalmagnetic field reproduces the motion of dislocations that facilitate the2D rotation of the stripes, highlighting the universality of thephenomenon. This work establishes a framework for studying thefield-driven behavior of topological textures and designing materialsthat enable well defined, controlled motion of defects in unconfinedsystems, paving the way to manipulate information carriers inhigher-dimensional systems.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05112"><em>arXiv:2501.05112</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">18 pages, 5figures</span></p><h3id="thermodynamics-of-a-compressible-lattice-gas-crystal-generalized-gibbs-duhem-equation-and-adsorption">Thermodynamicsof a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equationand adsorption</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sprik,+M">MichielSprik</a></span></p><p>Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science tounderstand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. Theseminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché-Cahn paper (Acta Metall.{} 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larché-Cahn theory are stableunder open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbsfree energy does not have to match the product <spanclass="math inline">\(\mu N\)</span> of the number of particles <spanclass="math inline">\(N\)</span> and their chemical potential <spanclass="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Discrepancies already arise underhydrostatic stress. The reason is that volume strain is defined withrespect to a fixed reference state. The elastic energy is notproportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids isviolated. Extensivity can be recovered by treating the number of latticesites <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as an additionalthermodynamic variable. This assigns a formal chemical potential <spanclass="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> to the immobile lattice sites. Thedifference $ G-N $ can be identified with <spanclass="math inline">\(\nu M\)</span>. We have worked this out for aone-component compressible lattice gas crystal.

We focuson a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of thetemperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. Wethen consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noisefluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and finda stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions thebias fluctuations enhance the current signal.

While mesoscalenumerical approaches to active nematic fluids have been developed, polarfluids are simulated as either ensembles of microscopic self-propelledparticles or continuous hydrodynamic-scale equations of motion. Tobetter simulate active polar fluids in complex geometries or as asolvent for suspensions, mesoscale numerical approaches are needed. Inthis work, the coarse-graining Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD)framework is applied to three active particle models to producemesoscale simulations of polar active fluids. The first active-polarMPCD (AP-MPCD) is a variant of the Vicsek model, while the second andthird variants allow the speed of the particles to relax towards aself-propulsion speed subject to Andersen and Langevin thermostats,respectively. Each of these AP-MPCD variants exhibit a flockingtransition at a critical activity and banding in the vicinity of thetransition point. We leverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to exploreflocking in the presence of external fields, which destroys banding, andanisotropic obstacles, which act as a ratchet that biases the flockingdirection. These results demonstrate the capacity of AP-MPCD to capturethe known phenomenology of polar active suspensions, and its versatilityto study active polar fluids in complex scenarios.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05167"><em>arXiv:2501.05167</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">16 pages, 18figures</span></p><h3id="rashba-effect-modulation-in-two-dimensional-a2b2te6-a-sb-bi-b-si-ge-materials-via-charge-transfer">Rashbaeffect modulation in two-dimensional A2B2Te6 (A = Sb, Bi; B = Si, Ge)materials via charge transfer</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wu,+H">HaipengWu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tian,+Q">QikunTian</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wei,+J">JinghuiWei</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xing,+Z">ZiyuXing</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Qin,+G">GuangzhaoQin</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Qin,+Z">ZhenzhenQin</a></span></p><p>Designing two-dimensional (2D) Rashba semiconductors, exploring theunderlying mechanism of Rashba effect, and further proposing efficientand controllable approaches are crucial for the development ofspintronics.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of thestate-of-the-art equivariant pretrained MLIP, SevenNet-0, in predictingkey properties of liquid electrolytes, including solvation behavior,density, and ion transport. To assess its suitability for extensivematerial screening, we considered a dataset comprising 20 solvents.Although SevenNet-0 was predominantly trained on inorganic compounds,its predictions for the properties of liquid electrolytes showed goodagreement with experimental and <span class="math inline">\(\textit{abinitio}\)</span> data. However, systematic errors were identified,particularly in the predicted density of liquid electrolytes. To addressthis limitation, we fine-tuned SevenNet-0, achieving improved accuracyat a significantly reduced computational cost compared to developingbespoke models.

Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO,which were previously unswitchable with an external field below theirdielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercivefields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchableferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory ofproximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics andferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. Thetheory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where themultilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression"where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximityferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by thepolarization of the layers and their relative thickness in aself-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectricpotential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Furtherreduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulkthat act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory toproximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayersis demonstrated.

However,the full transformative potential of molecular intercalation remainsunderexplored, largely due to the lack of simple, broadly applicablemethods that preserve high crystalline quality down to the few-layerlimit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic approach to intercalatedifferent molecules into various vdW materials under ambient conditions,leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals to enable aspontaneous molecular insertion. We employ our method, which isparticularly well-suited for the in-situ intercalation offew-layer-thick crystals, to intercalate nine vdW materials, includingmagnets and superconductors, with molecules ranging from conventionalalkylammonium ions to metallorganic and bio-inspired chiral cations.Notably, intercalation leads to a molecule-dependent enhancement of thesuperconducting transition in 2H-TaS2, reaching a critical temperatureof 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers. Additionally, RuCl3 exhibits anunprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagneticordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium. These results establishour approach as a versatile technique for engineering atomically thinquantum materials and heterostructures, unlocking the transformativeeffects of molecular intercalation.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05229"><em>arXiv:2501.05229</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="competition-of-superconducting-pairing-symmetries-in-la3ni2o7">Competitionof superconducting pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xu,+H">Han-XiangXu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xie,+Y">YueXie</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Guterding,+D">DanielGuterding</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+Z">ZhijunWang</a></span></p><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayerRuddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generatedmuch interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates.Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study ofsuperconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradictingresults.

It can be considered asMoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Suchclassification gave rise to the understanding of the electronicproperties of the material, but also to the prediction of other membersof the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classifythose. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor,some of the members of the family are also metallic and some evendemonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperaturemobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousandscm^2/V(hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some recordcases as high as 5^4 cm^22/V, making these materials strong contendersfor future electronic applications. The major interest towards thesematerials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allowsmultiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particularthose with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metalatoms.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05273"><em>arXiv:2501.05273</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Nature Reviews Physics volume6, pages 426-438 (2024)</span></p><h3 id="elliptical-stability-of-hopfions-in-bulk-helimagnets">Ellipticalstability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-10 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Metlov,+K+L">KonstantinL.

Previousstudies have primarily focused on topological bands with conventionals-wave pairing. However, topological Dirac semimetals exhibiting aunique orbital texture can favor unconventional pairing when electroniccorrelations are significant. The topology of vortices in these systemshas yet to be explored. In this work, we investigate the vortex boundstates in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a particular focus onthe orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates higher-orderMajorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double Majoranavortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, theseMajorana flat bands are located between the projections of twosuperconduting Dirac points. In contrast, in type-II Dirac semimetals,they extend across the entire 1D Brillouin zone. These double flat bandsarise from a nontrivial <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> topology defined by aneffective particle-hole symmetry and are protected by the four-foldrotational symmetry. Additionally, we observe that moving the vortexline close to a hinge can trivialize the higher-order Majorana arc onthe hinge, leaving a single Majorana mode at the vortex core due to thehybridization of Majorana modes.

In particular, we notethat interface dislocations formed during structural relaxationtranslate in unison when a heterodeformed BG is subjected to sheartraction, leading us to the hypothesis that the kinetic properties ofinterface dislocations determine the friction drag coefficient of theinterface. The constitutive law of the DFK model comprises thegeneralized stacking fault energy of the AB stacking, a scalardisplacement drag coefficient, and the elastic properties of graphene,which are all obtained from atomistic simulations. Simulations of theDFK model confirm our hypothesis since a single choice of thedisplacement drag coefficient, fit to the kinetic property of anindividual dislocation in an atomistic simulation, predicts interfacefriction in any heterodeformed BG. By bridging the gap betweendislocation kinetics at the microscale to interface friction at themacroscale, the DFK model enables a high-throughput investigation ofstrain-engineered vdW heterostructures.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05328"><em>arXiv:2501.05328</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="force-velocity-relationship-in-branched-actin-networks-consequences-of-entanglement-drag-and-stall-force">Force-VelocityRelationship in Branched Actin Networks: Consequences of Entanglement,Drag and Stall Force</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Badaoui,+M">MagidBadaoui</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dmitrieff,+S">SergeDmitrieff</a></span></p><p>We investigate the growth of a branched actin network under load.Using a combination of simulations and theory, we show that the networkadapts to the load and exhibits two regimes: a finite velocity at lowstress, followed by a power-law decay of the velocity as a function ofstress.

Fromthe mean square displacement calculations, we observe that, unlike aninertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active particle manifests aninitial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive, and theconventional long-time diffusive behavior. The intermediatesub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for theself-propulsion of an overdamped particle.

Signatures ofselection differed by environment, with forest-dwelling chimpanzeepopulations bearing variants in genes associated with diseaseresistance. This study demonstrates the utility of environmentallycollected DNA in an endangered species and provides insights intoadaptation in our closest living relative. --Corinne Simonti</p><p><ahref="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adn7954?af=R"><em>Science</em><strong>387</strong>, eadn7954 (2025)</a></p><h3id="decoding-the-molecular-interplay-of-cd20-and-therapeutic-antibodies-with-fast-volumetric-nanoscopy">Decodingthe molecular interplay of CD20 and therapeutic antibodies with fastvolumetric nanoscopy</h3><p>Research Article | <span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Nanoscopicimaging</span> | 2025-01-10 03:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Arindam Ghosh, Mara Meub,Dominic A.

We find that thesesuspensions exhibit a shear-thinning behavior at relatively lowconcentrations. At the microscale, this corresponds to a well-definedtransition in both the structure, marked by the appearance of a peak inthe static structure factor, and the dynamics, which slow down anddevelop a two-step decay in the correlation functions. Thislow-concentration transition is particularly surprising in light ofexperiments showing that for surfactant vesicles of similar compositionthe interactions should be purely repulsive. This leads us to proposethat the observed structural and dynamic transition could arise, as anentropic effect, from the large sample polydispersity coupled tocrowding. The shear-thinning behavior is thus interpreted as thenonlinear response of this transient structure to the imposed flow.

At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unitcell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levelsthat reflect its recursive construction. For most materials,Hofstadter's butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions thatare unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields. More recently,electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter'sbutterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large latticeconstants, such as those with moiré superlattices. Yet to-date, directspectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadternearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we usehigh-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM / STS)to probe the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene near thepredicted second magic angle, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studiesof Hofstadter's spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flatmoiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimentalsignatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, ourmeasurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electrondensity, displaying phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter's original modeldue to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulombinteractions, and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in twisted bilayergraphene.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04777"><em>arXiv:2501.04777</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">20 pages, 5figures</span></p><h3 id="a-phase-field-model-for-dna-self-assembly">A phase-field modelfor DNA self-assembly</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Cappa,+M">MarcoCappa</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sciortino,+F">FrancescoSciortino</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Rovigatti,+L">LorenzoRovigatti</a></span></p><p>We present a phase-field model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation toinvestigate the kinetics of phase separation in DNA nanostar systems.Leveraging a realistic free-energy functional derived from Wertheimtheory, our model captures the thermodynamic and dynamic properties ofself-assembling DNA nanostars under various conditions.

Compared to the previousworks where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time andno phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup wherethe quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In oursetup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and thephase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponentsthat determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analyticallyobtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is nophase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodicallydriven CFTs [1].

These new metrics provide a theoretical upper boundon CO2 captured per energy as well as a theoretical upper limit on thepurity of the captured CO2. These new metrics are based entirely onintrinsic material properties and are therefore agnostic to the designof the DAC system. These metrics apply to any adsorption-refresh cycledesign. In this work we demonstrate the use of these metrics with theexample of temperature-pressure swing refresh cycles. The mainrequirement for applying these metrics is to describe the equilibriumuptake (along with a few other materials properties) of each species interms of the thermodynamic variables (e.g. temperature, pressure). Wederive these metrics from thermodynamic energy balances. To apply thesemetrics on a set of examples, we first generated approximations of thenecessary materials properties for 11 660 metal-organic frameworkmaterials (MOFs). We find that the performance of the sorbents is highlydependent on the path through thermodynamic parameter space. Thesemetrics allow for: 1) finding the optimum materials given a particularrefresh cycle, and 2) finding the optimum refresh cycles given aparticular sorbent. Applying these metrics to the database of MOFs leadto the following insights: 1) start cold - the equilibrium uptake of CO2diverges from that of N2 at lower temperatures, and 2) selectivity ofCO2 vs other gases at any one point in the cycle does not matter - whatmatters is the relative change in uptake along the cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04825"><em>arXiv:2501.04825</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="training-allostery-inspired-mechanical-response-in-disordered-elastic-networks">TrainingAllostery-Inspired Mechanical Response in Disordered ElasticNetworks</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gowen,+S+D">SavannahD.

It has been found thatthe magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through thesimultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, themagnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by theformation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co andFe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we havedetermined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chainsconsisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactorshave been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximationof transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of theseprefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significantand non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitativelydescribes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers andthe frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from ourtheoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results ofnumerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimationof the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths,temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters.

It reveals that theauxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced bygenuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlationsare subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem.Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOMmethod featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute thenumerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within theone-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderatetemperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas hightemperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of thephonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. Thepronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the rangeof applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate tohigh temperatures, and not too fast phonons.

These features can be understood within approaches relying onthe timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such asthe transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them fromfully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchicalequations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper,we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near theadiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics verywell at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, thetransport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from thesubdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the bandcurrent dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevantfor transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that thesuper-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusivemotion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phononperiods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibitsa dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequencypeak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS,and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classicalsimulations.

LN's significance in photonics parallels silicon's inelectronics, addressing challenges like high power consumption and slowcommunication speeds, and offering potential for broad applications inoptical communications, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.Despite progress in developing LN-based photonic structures, achievinglow-loss, reconfigurable, and large-scale devices requires improvedprocessing techniques. This work introduces a quantum design methodologybased on LN's crystal structure, utilizing electron-phonon couplingthrough external field perturbations. Multiscale structural analysis isperformed with techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion massspectrometry, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, andX-ray absorption spectra to identify and control defect structures.Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorptionspectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory further reveal themechanisms of electron-phonon coupling. These findings establish aframework for designing LN-based quantum devices with enhancedperformance and diverse functionalities.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05060"><em>arXiv:2501.05060</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3 id="control-of-magnon-frequency-combs-in-magnetic-rings">Control ofmagnon frequency combs in magnetic rings</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-10 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Heins,+C">ChristopherHeins</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=K%C3%A1kay,+A">AttilaKákay</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim,+J">Joo-VonKim</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hlawacek,+G">GregorHlawacek</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Fassbender,+J">JürgenFassbender</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Schultheiss,+K">KatrinSchultheiss</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Schultheiss,+H">HelmutSchultheiss</a></span></p><p>Using Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we study the richdynamics in magnetic disks and rings governed by non-linearinteractions, focusing on the role of vortex core dynamics on thespin-wave eigenmode spectrum.

A common approach for self-assemblyis the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate usingtechnologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach oftenpresents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, andthe formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate theinfluence of substrate and particle wettability on the depositedpattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with ahexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate.Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation afterthe film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters.Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate theimpact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation ofhighly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting thesurface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initialfilm thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particlewettability, and validate these models with simulations.

The solution to this dilemma is related tounderstanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practicalimplications for the state of museum artefacts made of plasticisedpoly(vinyl chloride) - PVC and objects stored in their vicinity. Theconsequences of this process encompass aesthetic changes due to thepresence of exudates and dust deposition, an increase in air pollutionand the development of mechanical stresses. Therefore, this paperdiscusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to provide evidence andsupport the development of recommendations and guidelines forconservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly,the investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalatesrepresenting the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVCcollections. The predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission(evaporation) determining the rate-limiting step of the overallmigration process is considered a fundament for understanding thepotential environmental and mechanical risk. According to this concept,general correlations for various ortho-phthalates are proposed dependingon their molar mass with the support of molecular dynamics simulationsand NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for the majority of the PVCobjects in collections, the risk of accelerated migration upon mildremoval of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus, surface cleaningwould allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution byphthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mindsimplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, thestep-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification andquantification of plasticisers in objects made of or containingplasticised PVC, determination of the physical state of investigatedartefacts and rate-limiting process of plasticiser migration isproposed.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05090"><em>arXiv:2501.05090</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Preprint.

Their role as robust information carriers has alsogenerated much attention. However, controlling their motion remainschallenging, especially towards achieving motion along well-definedpaths which typically require predefined structural patterning. Here wedemonstrate the tunable, unidirectional motion of topological defects,specifically magnetic dislocations in a weak magnetic stripe pattern,induced by external magnetic field in a laterally unconfined thin film.This motion is shown to mediate the overall continuous rotation of thestripe pattern. We determine the connection between the unidirectionalmotion of dislocations and the underlying three-dimensional (3D)magnetic structure by performing 3D magnetic vectorial imaging with insitu magnetic fields. A minimal model for dislocations in stripepatterns that encodes the symmetry breaking induced by the externalmagnetic field reproduces the motion of dislocations that facilitate the2D rotation of the stripes, highlighting the universality of thephenomenon. This work establishes a framework for studying thefield-driven behavior of topological textures and designing materialsthat enable well defined, controlled motion of defects in unconfinedsystems, paving the way to manipulate information carriers inhigher-dimensional systems.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05112"><em>arXiv:2501.05112</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">18 pages, 5figures</span></p><h3id="thermodynamics-of-a-compressible-lattice-gas-crystal-generalized-gibbs-duhem-equation-and-adsorption">Thermodynamicsof a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equationand adsorption</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sprik,+M">MichielSprik</a></span></p><p>Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science tounderstand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. Theseminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché-Cahn paper (Acta Metall.{} 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larché-Cahn theory are stableunder open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbsfree energy does not have to match the product <spanclass="math inline">\(\mu N\)</span> of the number of particles <spanclass="math inline">\(N\)</span> and their chemical potential <spanclass="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Discrepancies already arise underhydrostatic stress. The reason is that volume strain is defined withrespect to a fixed reference state. The elastic energy is notproportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids isviolated. Extensivity can be recovered by treating the number of latticesites <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as an additionalthermodynamic variable. This assigns a formal chemical potential <spanclass="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> to the immobile lattice sites. Thedifference $ G-N $ can be identified with <spanclass="math inline">\(\nu M\)</span>. We have worked this out for aone-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted.The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of anadsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancycreation. The derivative of population with respect to chemicalpotential at constant pressure and temperature is compared to thecorresponding susceptibility in a fixed volume open system. We find thatthe difference is proportional to the elastic constant of the barelattice, confirming that this quantity is the crucial macroscopicproperty distinguishing a solid under hydrostatic stress from aliquid.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05117"><em>arXiv:2501.05117</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Statistical Mechanics(cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">19 pages</span></p><h3id="photon-assisted-stochastic-resonance-in-nanojunctions">Photon-assistedstochastic resonance in nanojunctions</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-10 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ridley,+M">MichaelRidley</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Bellassai,+L">LeoBellassai</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Moskalets,+M">MichaelMoskalets</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kantorovich,+L">LevKantorovich</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tuovinen,+R">RikuTuovinen</a></span></p><p>We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by aperiodically-varying external field.

This article made the initialendeavor to apply machine learning to predict the critical temperature(Tc) of liquid metal (LM) alloy superconductors. Leveraging the SuperCondataset, which includes extensive superconductor property data, wedeveloped a machine learning model to predict Tc. After addressing dataissues through preprocessing, we compared multiple models and found thatthe Extra Trees model outperformed others with an R2 of 0.9519 and anRMSE of 6.2624 K. This model is subsequently used to predict Tc for LMalloys, revealing In0.5Sn0.5 as having the highest Tc at 7.01 K.Furthermore, we extended the prediction to 2,145 alloys binary and45,670 ternary alloys across 66 metal elements and promising resultswere achieved. This work demonstrates the advantages of tree-basedmodels in predicting Tc and would help accelerate the discovery ofhigh-performance LM alloy superconductors in the coming time.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05164"><em>arXiv:2501.05164</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Superconductivity(cond-mat.supr-con)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">18 pages, 5 figures, 5tables</span></p><h3id="multi-particle-collision-framework-for-active-polar-fluids">Multi-ParticleCollision Framework for Active Polar Fluids</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Baziei,+O">OleksandrBaziei</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Loewe,+B">BenjamínLoewe</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Shendruk,+T+N">TylerN.

While mesoscalenumerical approaches to active nematic fluids have been developed, polarfluids are simulated as either ensembles of microscopic self-propelledparticles or continuous hydrodynamic-scale equations of motion. Tobetter simulate active polar fluids in complex geometries or as asolvent for suspensions, mesoscale numerical approaches are needed. Inthis work, the coarse-graining Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD)framework is applied to three active particle models to producemesoscale simulations of polar active fluids. The first active-polarMPCD (AP-MPCD) is a variant of the Vicsek model, while the second andthird variants allow the speed of the particles to relax towards aself-propulsion speed subject to Andersen and Langevin thermostats,respectively. Each of these AP-MPCD variants exhibit a flockingtransition at a critical activity and banding in the vicinity of thetransition point. We leverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to exploreflocking in the presence of external fields, which destroys banding, andanisotropic obstacles, which act as a ratchet that biases the flockingdirection. These results demonstrate the capacity of AP-MPCD to capturethe known phenomenology of polar active suspensions, and its versatilityto study active polar fluids in complex scenarios.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05167"><em>arXiv:2501.05167</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">16 pages, 18figures</span></p><h3id="rashba-effect-modulation-in-two-dimensional-a2b2te6-a-sb-bi-b-si-ge-materials-via-charge-transfer">Rashbaeffect modulation in two-dimensional A2B2Te6 (A = Sb, Bi; B = Si, Ge)materials via charge transfer</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wu,+H">HaipengWu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tian,+Q">QikunTian</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wei,+J">JinghuiWei</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xing,+Z">ZiyuXing</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Qin,+G">GuangzhaoQin</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Qin,+Z">ZhenzhenQin</a></span></p><p>Designing two-dimensional (2D) Rashba semiconductors, exploring theunderlying mechanism of Rashba effect, and further proposing efficientand controllable approaches are crucial for the development ofspintronics.

Recently, pretrained universal machine-learninginteratomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as promising tools forcomputational exploration of complex chemical spaces with high accuracyand efficiency. In this study, we evaluated the performance of thestate-of-the-art equivariant pretrained MLIP, SevenNet-0, in predictingkey properties of liquid electrolytes, including solvation behavior,density, and ion transport. To assess its suitability for extensivematerial screening, we considered a dataset comprising 20 solvents.Although SevenNet-0 was predominantly trained on inorganic compounds,its predictions for the properties of liquid electrolytes showed goodagreement with experimental and <span class="math inline">\(\textit{abinitio}\)</span> data. However, systematic errors were identified,particularly in the predicted density of liquid electrolytes. To addressthis limitation, we fine-tuned SevenNet-0, achieving improved accuracyat a significantly reduced computational cost compared to developingbespoke models.

Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO,which were previously unswitchable with an external field below theirdielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercivefields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchableferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory ofproximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics andferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. Thetheory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where themultilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression"where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximityferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by thepolarization of the layers and their relative thickness in aself-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectricpotential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Furtherreduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulkthat act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory toproximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayersis demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers ofdielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers canpotentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric orparaelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, anexciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozenferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises alarge class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previouslyunrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memorytechnologies.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05219"><em>arXiv:2501.05219</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">42 pages including 7 figuresand 4 Appendices.

However,the full transformative potential of molecular intercalation remainsunderexplored, largely due to the lack of simple, broadly applicablemethods that preserve high crystalline quality down to the few-layerlimit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic approach to intercalatedifferent molecules into various vdW materials under ambient conditions,leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals to enable aspontaneous molecular insertion. We employ our method, which isparticularly well-suited for the in-situ intercalation offew-layer-thick crystals, to intercalate nine vdW materials, includingmagnets and superconductors, with molecules ranging from conventionalalkylammonium ions to metallorganic and bio-inspired chiral cations.Notably, intercalation leads to a molecule-dependent enhancement of thesuperconducting transition in 2H-TaS2, reaching a critical temperatureof 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers. Additionally, RuCl3 exhibits anunprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagneticordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium.

It can be considered asMoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Suchclassification gave rise to the understanding of the electronicproperties of the material, but also to the prediction of other membersof the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classifythose. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor,some of the members of the family are also metallic and some evendemonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperaturemobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousandscm^2/V(hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some recordcases as high as 5^4 cm^22/V, making these materials strong contendersfor future electronic applications. The major interest towards thesematerials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allowsmultiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particularthose with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metalatoms.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05273"><em>arXiv:2501.05273</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Nature Reviews Physics volume6, pages 426-438 (2024)</span></p><h3 id="elliptical-stability-of-hopfions-in-bulk-helimagnets">Ellipticalstability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-10 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Metlov,+K+L">KonstantinL.

Previousstudies have primarily focused on topological bands with conventionals-wave pairing. However, topological Dirac semimetals exhibiting aunique orbital texture can favor unconventional pairing when electroniccorrelations are significant. The topology of vortices in these systemshas yet to be explored. In this work, we investigate the vortex boundstates in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a particular focus onthe orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates higher-orderMajorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double Majoranavortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, theseMajorana flat bands are located between the projections of twosuperconduting Dirac points. In contrast, in type-II Dirac semimetals,they extend across the entire 1D Brillouin zone. These double flat bandsarise from a nontrivial <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> topology defined by aneffective particle-hole symmetry and are protected by the four-foldrotational symmetry. Additionally, we observe that moving the vortexline close to a hinge can trivialize the higher-order Majorana arc onthe hinge, leaving a single Majorana mode at the vortex core due to thehybridization of Majorana modes. Finally, we discuss the potentialexperimental implications for correlated Dirac semimetals, such aselectron-doped iron-based superconductors.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05317"><em>arXiv:2501.05317</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Superconductivity(cond-mat.supr-con), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">9 pages, 6 figures</span></p><h3id="quantifying-superlubricity-of-bilayer-graphene-from-the-mobility-of-interface-dislocations">Quantifyingsuperlubricity of bilayer graphene from the mobility of interfacedislocations</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-10 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ahmed,+M+T">MdTusher Ahmed</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Choi,+M">Moon-kiChoi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Johnson,+H+T">HarleyT Johnson</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Admal,+N+C">NikhilChandra Admal</a></span></p><p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures subjected to interlayer twistsor heterostrains demonstrate structural superlubricity, leading to theirpotential use as superlubricants in micro- and nano-electro-mechanicaldevices. However, quantifying superlubricity across the vastfour-dimensional heterodeformation space using experiments oratomic-scale simulations is a challenging task. In this work, we developan atomically informed dynamic Frenkel--Kontorova (DFK) model forpredicting the interface friction drag coefficient of an arbitrarilyheterodeformed bilayer graphene (BG) system. The model is motivated byMD simulations of friction in heterodeformed BG. In particular, we notethat interface dislocations formed during structural relaxationtranslate in unison when a heterodeformed BG is subjected to sheartraction, leading us to the hypothesis that the kinetic properties ofinterface dislocations determine the friction drag coefficient of theinterface. The constitutive law of the DFK model comprises thegeneralized stacking fault energy of the AB stacking, a scalardisplacement drag coefficient, and the elastic properties of graphene,which are all obtained from atomistic simulations. Simulations of theDFK model confirm our hypothesis since a single choice of thedisplacement drag coefficient, fit to the kinetic property of anindividual dislocation in an atomistic simulation, predicts interfacefriction in any heterodeformed BG. By bridging the gap betweendislocation kinetics at the microscale to interface friction at themacroscale, the DFK model enables a high-throughput investigation ofstrain-engineered vdW heterostructures.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05328"><em>arXiv:2501.05328</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="force-velocity-relationship-in-branched-actin-networks-consequences-of-entanglement-drag-and-stall-force">Force-VelocityRelationship in Branched Actin Networks: Consequences of Entanglement,Drag and Stall Force</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Badaoui,+M">MagidBadaoui</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dmitrieff,+S">SergeDmitrieff</a></span></p><p>We investigate the growth of a branched actin network under load.Using a combination of simulations and theory, we show that the networkadapts to the load and exhibits two regimes: a finite velocity at lowstress, followed by a power-law decay of the velocity as a function ofstress.

In this work, we take a step towardexploring this direction by investigating correlation-driveninstabilities of Hopf insulators. Organizing our analysis around thetopological quantum critical point that separates the Hopf insulatingphase from a trivial insulator, we demonstrate the emergence ofunconventional Weyl semimetallic and topological insulating states.Notably, the Weyl semimetal supports non-reciprocal superconductivityand a Bogoliubov-Fermi surface, potentially providing a novel frameworkfor realizing the superconducting diode effect.

Fromthe mean square displacement calculations, we observe that, unlike aninertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active particle manifests aninitial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive, and theconventional long-time diffusive behavior. The intermediatesub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for theself-propulsion of an overdamped particle. It can be understood bychirality-induced transient confinement, which persists for short timeintervals and diffuses away in the time asymptotic limit or at thesteady state. This behavior is further complemented by the exactcalculation of mean square velocity or effective kinetic temperature ofthe medium, which is a decreasing function of the magnitude ofchirality. Moreover, the steady-state MSD and MSV are found to have adependence both on chirality and activity time scale and hence can becontrolled by tuning the persistent duration of activity or strength ofthe chirality of the particle.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05390"><em>arXiv:2501.05390</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">9 pages, 8 figures</span></p><h3id="analytical-control-of-the-exchange-interaction-in-periodically-driven-mott-insulators">Analyticalcontrol of the exchange interaction in periodically driven Mottinsulators</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-10 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tierz,+M">MiguelTierz</a></span></p><p>The manipulation of electronic structure through periodic electricfields enables the reversible control of effective interactions inextended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators on ultrafast timescales.

We show that the probe particle exhibits a depinning-likethreshold from an elastic regime, where the probe particle is trapped byinteractions with the other particles, to a plastic flow regime, wherethe probe particle can break bonds in the surrounding medium. For afixed particle density, the depinning threshold and sliding velocity ofthe probe particle vary nonmonotonically as the attraction term isincreased. A velocity minimum appears near the crystal to stripecrossover, and there is a significant increase in the depinningthreshold in the bubble regime when the probe particle is stronglyconfined inside the bubbles. For fixed attractive interaction butincreasing particle density, the behavior is also nonmonotonic and thereare jumps and drops in the velocity and depinning thresholdcorresponding to points at which the system transitions betweendifferent structures. There are also several distinct flow states thatcan be characterized by the amount of plastic deformation induced by theprobe particle in the surrounding medium. Each flow state generates adifferent amount of effective drag on the probe particle, and there canbe jumps in the velocity-force curve at transitions between the states.We also find that when oriented stripes are present, the probe particlecan move along the stripe in an edge transport state that has a finiteHall angle.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05421"><em>arXiv:2501.05421</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">12 pages, 17figures</span></p><h3id="how-quantum-selection-rules-influence-the-magneto-optical-effects-of-driven-ultrafast-magnetization-dynamics">Howquantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven,ultrafast magnetization dynamics</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Elhanoty,+M+F">MohamedF.

This conventional approachoverlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules,governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, thatforms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. Byemploying fully time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal thatthese selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation ofultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcpCo and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, asrevealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay ofoptical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selectionrules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highlyenergy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstandingdiscrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that onlythrough meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage,can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its truenature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice ofprobe energy.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05433"><em>arXiv:2501.05433</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="interplay-between-altermagnetism-and-topological-superconductivity-in-an-unconventional-superconducting-platform">Interplaybetween altermagnetism and topological superconductivity in anunconventional superconducting platform</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-1020:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Chatterjee,+P">PritamChatterjee</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Juri%C4%8Di%C4%87,+V">VladimirJuričić</a></span></p><p>We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay betweenaltermagnetism and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wavesuperconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phasetransitions in a two-dimensional (2D) <spanclass="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave superconductor, considering bothchiral and helical phases.

Here we demonstrate amethod for coherently steering the reaction flux across differentproduct spin channels for a three-body recombination process in a cloudof trapped cold atoms. We use a magnetically tunable Feshbach resonanceto admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reactingcollision complex. This allows us to control the reaction flux into theadmixed spin channel, which can be used to alter the reaction products.We also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reactiondynamics, observing a global enhancement of three-body recombinationwithout favouring particular reaction channels. Our control scheme canbe extended to other reaction processes and could be combined with othermethods, such as quantum interference of reaction paths, to achievefurther tuning capabilities of few-body reactions.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02726-3"><i>Nat.Phys.</i> (2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Atomic and molecularcollision processes, Chemistry, Ultracold gases</span></p><h3id="thermally-driven-quantum-refrigerator-autonomously-resets-a-superconducting-qubit">Thermallydriven quantum refrigerator autonomously resets a superconductingqubit</h3><p>Original Paper | Quantum information | 2025-01-08 19:00 EST</p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mohammed Ali Aamir, PaulJamet Suria, José Antonio Marín Guzmán, Claudia Castillo-Moreno, JeffreyM.

We use it to cool a transmon qubit to atemperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath,thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantumcomputing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and isautonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits anengineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and twoauxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heatbath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesizedquasithermal radiation.

However, different topologicalsystems often require different topological invariants to measure, andtheses definition usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it'schallenging to predict what would occur during the transformationbetween two different topological phases. To address these issues, wepropose a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance fromquantum information theory: manifold distance (MD). This definition doesnot rely on the berry connection but rather on the information of thetwo manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measuredifferent topological systems (including traditional band topologymodels, non-Hermitian systems, and gapless systems, etc.) and exhibitsome universal laws during the transformation between two topologicalphases. Our research demonstrates for different topological manifolds,the change rate (first-order derivative) or susceptibility (second-orderderivative) of MD exhibit various divergent behaviors near the criticalpoints. Compared to the strange correlator, which could be used as adiagnosis for short-range entangled states in 1D and 2D, MD is moreuniversal and could be applied to non-Hermitian systems and long-rangeentangled states. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to begeneralized to real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitatethe study of a wider range of physical platforms such as open systemsand many-body localization.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04054"><em>arXiv:2501.04054</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">arXiv admin note: substantialtext overlap with arXiv:2405.03323</span></p><h3id="electromechanical-coupling-coefficient-new-approach-to-study-auxetic-piezoelectric-harvesters">ElectromechanicalCoupling Coefficient: New Approach to Study Auxetic PiezoelectricHarvesters</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0920:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Forges,+G">GrégoireForges</a> (SYMME, IMS),<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gibus,+D">DavidGibus</a> (SYMME),<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Morel,+A">AdrienMorel</a> (SYMME),<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Badel,+A">AdrienBadel</a> (SYMME),<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Deb%C3%A9da,+H">HéléneDebéda</a> (IMS)</span></p><p>This work introduces a novel methodology to assess the performance ofPiezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEHs) in order to study auxeticenhancement possibilities.

This work proposes,and demonstrates through theory and numerical simulations, a strategy toachieve large and controlled actuation by exploiting theelectromechanical analog of the Treloar-Kearsley (TK) instability. Thekey idea is to use the fact that the TK instability is asymmetry-breaking bifurcation, which implies the existence of asymmetry-driven constant-energy region in the energy landscape. Thisprovides for nonlinear soft modes with large deformations that can beaccessed with very small external stimulus, which is achieved here byapplying a small in-plane electric field. First, the bifurcation andpost-bifurcation behavior of the electromechanical TK instability areestablished theoretically in the idealized setting of uniformdeformation and electric field. Next, building on this, a finite elementanalysis of a realistic geometry with patterned top and bottomelectrodes is applied to demonstrate large and soft shape changes drivenby small voltage differences across the electrodes.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04128"><em>arXiv:2501.04128</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Physical Review Applied,23:014007, 2025</span></p><h3id="quantum-electrodynamics-of-graphene-landau-levels-in-a-deep-subwavelength-hyperbolic-phonon-polariton-cavity">QuantumElectrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelengthhyperbolic phonon polariton cavity</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Andolina,+G+M">GianMarcello Andolina</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ceccanti,+M">MatteoCeccanti</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Turini,+B">BiancaTurini</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Riolo,+R">RiccardoRiolo</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Polini,+M">MarcoPolini</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Schir%C3%B3,+M">MarcoSchiró</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Koppens,+F+H">FrankH.L.

Understanding how processing conditions influencethe nanoscale arrangement and microstructure is critical for engineeringmaterials with desired macroscopic properties. Microstructural featuressuch as grain boundaries, lattice defects, and pores significantlyaffect these properties but are challenging to quantify usingtraditional manual analyses as they are labor-intensive and prone toerrors. In this work, we present a machine learning workflow forautomating grain segmentation in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)images of nanoparticle superlattices. This workflow integrates signalprocessing techniques, such as Radon transforms, with unsupervisedlearning methods like agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identifyand segment grains without requiring manually annotated data. In theworkflow we transform the raw pixel data into explainable numericalrepresentation of superlattice orientations for clustering. Benchmarkingresults demonstrate the workflow's robustness against noisy images andedge cases, with a processing speed of four images per minute onstandard computational hardware. This efficiency makes the workflowscalable to large datasets and makes it a valuable tool for integratingdata-driven models into decision-making processes for material designand analysis. For example, one can use this workflow to quantify grainsize distributions at varying processing conditions like temperature andpressure and using that knowledge adjust processing conditions toachieve desired superlattice orientations and grain sizes.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04172"><em>arXiv:2501.04172</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)</span></p><h3id="multichannel-dyson-equations-for-even--and-odd-order-greens-functions-application-to-double-excitations">MultichannelDyson equations for even- and odd-order Green's functions: applicationto double excitations</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Riva,+G">GabrieleRiva</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Fischer,+T">ThéodoreFischer</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Paggi,+S">StefanoPaggi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Berger,+J+A">J.Arjan Berger</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Romaniello,+P">PinaRomaniello</a></span></p><p>We extend the concept of the multichannel Dyson equation that we haverecently derived to model photoemission spectra by coupling the one- andthe three-body Green's functions, to higher-order Green's functions andto other spectroscopies.

Here, we present a skin-inspired method to encode strainvectors directly within a sensor. This is achieved by leveraging thestrain-tunable quantum properties of electronic bands in the van derWaals topological semimetal Td -WTe2. We observe robust and independentresponses from the second-order and third-order nonlinear Hall signalsin Td -WTe2 when subjected to variations in both the magnitude anddirection of strain. Through rigorous temperature-dependent measurementsand scaling law analysis, we establish that these strain responsesprimarily stem from quantum geometry-related phenomena, including theBerry curvature and Berry-connection polarizability tensor. Furthermore,our study demonstrates that the strain-dependent nonlinear Hall signalscan efficiently encode high-dimensional strain information using asingle device. This capability enables accurate and comprehensivesensing of complex strain patterns in the embossed character "NJU".

Itgenerally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarizationbeyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems,where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonalto the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, wedemonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching byfabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possiblebecause the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interfaceprecess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing anultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is furtherconfirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-planeinitialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfullycombined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especiallytaking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allowsus to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our workdemonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of largespin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and indoing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waalsmagnets and oxide spintronics.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04235"><em>arXiv:2501.04235</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other), AppliedPhysics (physics.app-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Accepted by AdvancedMaterials (2025); 47 pages, 4 main figures, 16 supportingfigures</span></p><h3id="high-throughput-studies-of-novel-magnetic-materials-in-borides">High-ThroughputStudies of Novel Magnetic Materials in Borides</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0920:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+Z">ZhenZhang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Belashchenko,+K+D">KirillD.

Successfully applying the workflow, wereport three families of novel magnetic borides, including two familiesof borides exhibiting quantum magnetism. One is a family of dimerizedquantum magnets among YCrB<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>-typeborides, which provides a rare platform for studying the spin-gapquantum critical point. The other is a family of altermagnets amongFeMo<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>B<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span>-type borides, extending the magneticorderings exhibited by borides beyond conventional ferromagnetism andantiferromagnetism. We also predict a family of magnetic laminatetransition metal borides, known as the MAB phases, in the AlFe<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span>B<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span>-type family, which provide pure-phaseor alloying candidates for studying magnetocaloric materials and theassociated magnetic transitions.

Its transition rate is usually calculated usingthe equal-mode approximation, which assumes that phonon modes andfrequencies remain unchanged before and after the transition. Using thecarbon substitutional defect (<spanclass="math inline">\(\text{C}_\text{N}\)</span>) in GaN as a benchmark,here we demonstrate that the phonon renormalization can be significantduring defect relaxation, which causes errors as large as orders ofmagnitude in the approximation. To address this issue, we consider (i)Duschinsky matrix connecting the initial-state and final-state phonons,which accounts for the changes in phonon modes and frequencies; and (ii)the off-diagonal contributions in total transition matrix element, whichincorporates the cross terms of electron-phonon interactions betweendifferent modes. With this improvement, the calculated transition ratesshow agreements with experimental results within an order of magnitude.We believe the present method makes one step forward for the accuratecalculation of multiphonon transition rate, especially in cases withlarge defect relaxations.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04289"><em>arXiv:2501.04289</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="anisotropy-of-pbte-nanowires-with-and-without-a-superconductor">Anisotropyof PbTe nanowires with and without a superconductor</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+Z">ZonglinLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Song,+W">WenyuSong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+S">ShanZhang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+Y">YuhaoWang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+Z">ZhaoyuWang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yu,+Z">ZehaoYu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+R">RuidongLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yan,+Z">ZeyuYan</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xu,+J">JiayeXu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gao,+Y">YichunGao</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+S">ShuaiYang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+L">LiningYang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Feng,+X">XiaoFeng</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+T">TiantianWang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zang,+Y">YunyiZang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+L">LinLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Shang,+R">RunanShang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xue,+Q">Qi-KunXue</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=He,+K">KeHe</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+H">HaoZhang</a></span></p><p>We investigate the anisotropic behaviors in PbTe and PbTe-Pb hybridnanowires.

The optimal protocol is closely linked to the intrinsicdynamics of the system at hand. The fact that these dynamics can varywidely has made a general solution elusive. Recent years have seen greatprogress by recasting the question in terms of a quantity called totalactivity, i.e. the average number of jumps between states of the system,rather than the time that the operation is allowed to take. Thisperspective has allowed for general expressions for the minimal work asa function of the total activity, and the minimal total activityrequired for a given work. The expression for minimal total activity canbe recast as an apparent minimal operation time or speed limit. However,it is unclear whether protocols optimized under a constrained activityactually require the lowest work input for a given operation time. Inthe context of bit reset, we show that directly minimizing work for agiven operation time leads to protocols that require significantly lesswork to perform the operation than the activity-constrained protocol ofthe same duration. We show how the resulting protocols differ. Onereason for the difference is the fact that the activity rate is notconstant over the course of the protocol: it depends on both thetransition rates and the distribution of the bit, both of which changeduring the copy operation. In the limit of long protocol duration, wefind an expression for the difference between the resulting minimal workfor both optimization schemes, for a general class of dynamics. Thetime-constrained approach always outperforms the activity-constrainedapproach for a given constrained duration, and the difference in workcan be arbitrarily large.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04439"><em>arXiv:2501.04439</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Statistical Mechanics(cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">15 pages, 3figures</span></p><h3id="partition-function-zeros-for-the-blume-capel-model-on-a-complete-graph">Partitionfunction zeros for the Blume-Capel model on a complete graph</h3><p>New Submission | Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) |2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Honchar,+Y">YulianHonchar</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Krasnytska,+M">MarianaKrasnytska</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Berche,+B">BertrandBerche</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Holovatch,+Y">YurijHolovatch</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kenna,+R">RalphKenna</a></span></p><p>In this paper we study finite-size effects in the Blume-Capel modelthrough the analysis of the zeros of the partition function.

However, for ternaryamorphous systems, the different possible phase diagram types and theirexistence conditions are still unclear. Based on the systematicscreening of the parameter space for three amorphous ternary materialsystems representative of polymer, small molecule, and solventmaterials, we report identifying twenty-one phase diagram typesgenerated using Flory-Huggins theory. The proposed classification relieson the number of immiscible material pairs, distinct miscibility gaps,and three-phase regions. We infer existence rules by mapping the type ofphase diagram to the range of interaction parameters in thethree-dimensional parameter space. Depending on the number of immisciblepairs (0, 1, 2, or 3), four well-known phase-diagram types are found tobe very likely. However, numerous uncommon phase diagrams are observedwithin a small parameter window around the critical interactionparameter values. Regarding the processability window, the size of themiscible region becomes sensitive to interaction parameter variations,mainly when they are close to critical values. The sensitivity decreasesfor materials with increasing molar size. Finally, the paper includes asuccessful comparison of simulated phase diagrams with experimentaldata, showcasing the real-world relevance of this theoretical analysisand its applicability for optimizing solution processing methodsefficiently.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04478"><em>arXiv:2501.04478</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="anomalous-topological-edge-modes-in-a-periodically-driven-trimer-lattice">Anomaloustopological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ghuneim,+M">MohammadGhuneim</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Bomantara,+R+W">RadityaWeda Bomantara</a></span></p><p>Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation forestablishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart.In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extendedSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with three sites per unit cell,obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their <spanclass="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span> counterparts.

Despite of thesebenefits, MgH2 unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics make it difficultto use in real applications. In this work, the hydrogen storageproperties of MgH2have been improved using Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropyalloy (HEA) based catalysts, which has been synthesized via mechanicalalloying. The experimental findings show that the beginning desorptiontemperature of MgH2significantly lowered from 425°C to 180°C by adding 5wt. % Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA in MgH2. Moreover, the catalyst shows enhancedkinetics, attaining 7.3 wt. % hydrogen absorption in 3 minutes at 320°Cwith 15 atm hydrogen pressure, and ~5 wt. % desorption in 6 minutes at320°C. These results highlight, how much lower its desorptiontemperature is than those of other well-known catalysts. Over a span of25 cycles, MgH2 catalyzed by Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA exhibits remarkablecyclic stability with negligible fluctuations (~ 0.05 wt. %).After athorough characterization of the materials, a workable catalyticmechanism for HEA was proposed in light of the results.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04516"><em>arXiv:2501.04516</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">39 pages, 10Figures</span></p><h3id="incommensurate-quantum-magnet-based-on-4f-electron-in-a-zigzag-spin-12-chain-of-ybcus_2">Incommensuratequantum magnet based on 4f-electron in a zigzag spin-1/2 chain ofYbCuS<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span></h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Onimaru,+T">T.Onimaru</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ohmagari,+Y">Y.Ohmagari</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Mizutani,+S">S.Mizutani</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yamamoto,+R">R.Yamamoto</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kaneshima,+H">H.Kaneshima</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Moriyoshi,+C">C.Moriyoshi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Adroja,+D+T">D.T.

A strongdependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisonswith metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about thepotential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. Therise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metalcombinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking oftheoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, andthe impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. Thesurface science approach is particularly well-suited for this taskbecause it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atomand interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects oftemperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stabilitycan be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studiestested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemicalsetups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specificsystems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbonnitrides, where insights from surface science experiments cansignificantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04539"><em>arXiv:2501.04539</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Surface Science 754 (2025)122687</span></p><h3id="hallmarks-of-spin-textures-for-high-harmonic-generation">Hallmarksof Spin Textures for High-Harmonic Generation</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-09 20:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gabriele,+F">FrancescoGabriele</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ortix,+C">CarmineOrtix</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Cuoco,+M">MarioCuoco</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Forte,+F">FilomenaForte</a></span></p><p>Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects inmodern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations inmomentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature.

Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finiteeven-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotationalsymmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvaturein systems with time-reversal invariance.

Hydrodynamic theories havebeen successfully applied to describe the large scale dynamics of activematerials. Yet, the hydrodynamic limit requires a separation of scaleswhich is not necessarily fulfilled among living systems. In this work,we propose a novel agent-based model of flexible rods exchanging activeforce dipoles with nematic symmetry, allowing us to explore theirbehavior down to the sub-agent scale. We obtain spontaneous flows andself-propulsion of <span class="math inline">\(+1/2\)</span> topologicaldefects, hallmarks of the hydrodynamic theory of active nematics, evenon scales smaller than the individual agent! Moreover, our results gobeyond the hydrodynamic framework, identifying novel correlationsbetween orientation and flows or strong asymmetries between contractileand extensile activity. Finally, we show the versatility of ouragent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensionsand nematic tissue growth. Because living systems like cell tissuesoften exhibit several sources of activity, our framework opens the wayfor more integrated descriptions of living materials.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04559"><em>arXiv:2501.04559</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft), Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)</span></p><h3id="designing-guidance-for-multiple-valley-based-topological-states-driven-by-magnetic-substrates-potential-applications-at-high-temperatures">DesigningGuidance for Multiple Valley-based Topological States Driven by MagneticSubstrates: Potential Applications at High Temperatures</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0920:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hong,+X">XiyuHong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+Z">ZheLi</a></span></p><p>Valley-based topological phases offer a wealth of exotic quantumstates with tunable functionalities, driven by the valley degree offreedom. In this work, by constructing heterostructures of germanene(silicene, stanene) on various magnetic substrates, we address keytuning factors such as the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength of thesubstrate, magnetic orientations, and stacking orders, all of whichgovern multiple valley-based topological features. We present acomprehensive guiding principle for the efficient manipulation of thesefeatures, achieved simply by designing and modulating the magneticproperties of the underlying substrates. Specifically, increasing theSOC strength of the magnetic substrate acilitates a range of topologicalphase transitions characterized by different Chern numbers, with manysystems exhibiting a transition from quantum valley Hall to quantumanomalous Hall (QAH) states. Additionally, rotating the in-planemagnetic orientation of the substrate enables tunability of the Chernnumber and chirality, within a moderate range of SOC strength.Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic coupling of the magnetic substratecan induce valley-based QAH states with substantial valley gaps,leveraging its high Curie temperature (TC) to enable the realization ofmultiple tunable magnetic topologies at elevated temperatures.

In quantum batteries, thetotal amount of stored work can be measured by ergotropy, which is themaximal work extractable by unitary operations. Transporting ergotropyis fundamentally different from transporting energy, and here we findthat ergotropy can be gained even when the transmission channel isstrictly energy conserving. We show that, generically, ergotropytransport is lossy whenever the two systems start uncorrelated. Incontrast, for a large class of correlated initial states, transport canbe gainful. Furthermore, a single correlated state can be used multipletimes, allowing to transport without losses an order of magnitude morework than the battery capacity. Correlations are thus a useful resourcefor ergotropy transport, and we quantify how this resource is consumedduring gainful transport.</p><p><ahref="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.010408"><em>Phys.Rev.

To explain theanomalous scaling exponent, we develop a solvable Landau-Zener modelthat takes into account the role of topological edge band that dominatesthe phase transition. For a two-dimensional boundary-obstructedhigher-order topological system, the Kibble-Zurek scaling must bemodified to adopt the effective dimension of topological edge bandinstead of the real physical dimension. We also find that across theboundary-obstructed higher-order topological phase transition, boundaryconditions can drastically modify the scaling behaviors.

Here, we develop a general theoreticalframework to study OC of CRNs for changing the system from an initialdistribution of states to a final distribution with minimum dissipation.We derive a ''Kirchhoff's law'' for the probability current in theadiabatic limit, from which the optimal kinetic rates are determinedanalytically for any given probability trajectory allowed by local rateconstraints. By using the optimal rates, we show that the totaldissipation is determined by a <spanclass="math inline">\({L}_{2}\)</span>-distance measure in theprobability space and derive an analytical expression for the metrictensor that depends on the probability distribution, network topology,and capacity of each link. Minimizing the total dissipation leads to thegeodesic trajectory in the probability space and the corresponding OCprotocol is determined by the Kirchhoff's law. To demonstrate ourgeneral approach, we use it to find a lower bound for the minimumdissipation that is tighter than existing bounds obtained with onlyglobal constraints in the adiabatic limit. We also apply it to simplenetworks, e.g., fully connected three-state CRNs with different localconstraints and show that indirect pathway and nonfunctional transientstate can play a crucial role in switching between different probabilitydistributions efficiently.

This paper applies a phase-field fracture model to study thisfracture process. While phase-field fracture models have severaladvantages, they provide unphysical predictions when the stress state iscomplex and includes compression that can cause crack faces to contact.Building on a phase-field model that accounts for compressive tractionacross the crack face, this paper extends the model to anisotropicfracture. The key features include: (1) a homogenized anisotropicelastic response and strongly-anisotropic model for the work tofracture; (2) an effective damage response that accounts consistentlyfor compressive traction across the crack face, that is derived from theanisotropic elastic response; (3) a regularized crack normal field thatovercomes the shortcomings of the isotropic setting, and enables thecorrect crack response, both across and transverse to the crack face. Totest the model, we first compare the predictions to phase-field fractureevolution calculations in a fully-resolved layered specimen with spatialinhomogeneity, and show that it captures the overall patterns of crackgrowth. We then apply the model to previously-reported experimentalobservations of fracture evolution in laboratory specimens of shalesunder compression with confinement, and find that it predicts well theobserved crack patterns in a broad range of loading conditions. Wefurther apply the model to predict the growth of wing cracks undercompression and confinement. The effective crack response model enablesus to treat the initial crack simply as a non-singular damaged zonewithin the computational domain, thereby allowing for easy and generalcomputations.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01468"><em>arXiv:2501.01468</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">To appear in InternationalJournal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics</span></p><h3 id="monitorization-of-the-h-o-bond-flexibility">Monitorization ofthe H-O Bond Flexibility</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0600:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sun,+C+Q">ChangQ Sun</a></span></p><p>Unlike conventional thought, the H-O bond is flexible, instead, andsensitive to perturbation.

Inspired by thesesystems, we developed a novel, solvent-free dual-network adhesive basedon a self-assembling ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methylmethacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), designed for applications requiring both highstrength and stretchability. The triblock copolymer forms a physicallycrosslinked network through microdomains of PMMA end-blocks that providestructural integrity, while the PnBA mid-block forms a soft, stretchablematrix. To further enhance mechanical performance, a second poly(n-butylacrylate) (PnBA) network is polymerized in situ, locking the PMMAmicrodomains in place and creating a load-bearing system. By varying thecrosslinking density of the secondary network, we tailor the adhesive'smechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17 - 1.18 MPa) to suitdifferent substrates, creating a mechanically transparent seam. Theresulting dual-network system combines different strategies to achievehigh strength and stretchability, with adhesive performance comparableto industrial methods such as sewing, particularly in bonding neoprenefabric composites and sealing the joints. Our solvent-free approach alsoeliminates the need for lengthy solvent evaporation steps, offering aneco-friendly and more efficient alternative for flexible adhesiveapplications in fields such as soft robotics, flexible electronics, andsports apparel.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01522"><em>arXiv:2501.01522</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">28 pages, 5 figures,supplemental included at the end</span></p><h3id="magnetoconductivity-and-quantum-oscillations-in-intercalated-graphite-cac_6-with-the-fermi-surface-reconstructed-by-the-uniaxial-charge-density-wave">Magnetoconductivityand quantum oscillations in intercalated graphite CaC<spanclass="math inline">\(_6\)</span> with the Fermi surface reconstructedby the uniaxial charge density wave</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-06 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Grozi%C4%87,+P">PetraGrozić</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kadigrobov,+A+M">AnatolyM.

Inthis work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-blackphosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have anintricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts aquasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density ofstates, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likelyto emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproducesthis band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phaseswhen interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, wefind that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave(SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degeneratewave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring thephase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength,we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulatortransition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDWcorrelations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, inparticular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitationswhich should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01563"><em>arXiv:2501.01563</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">15 pages, 14figures</span></p><h3id="anomalous-skew-scattering-of-plasma-waves-in-a-dirac-electron-fluid">Anomalousskew scattering of plasma waves in a Dirac electron fluid</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-06 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Finnigan,+C">CooperFinnigan</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Efimkin,+D">DmitryEfimkin</a></span></p><p>The Berry phase-related nontrivial electronic band geometries cansignificantly influence bulk and edge plasma waves, or plasmons,resulting in their non-reciprocal propagation and opening newopportunities for plasmonics.

Our approach is based on comparingthe steady-state current in simple models to reference models without aninactive site. We identify two parameter regimes in which the reactionis accelerated. We then find the transition rates that maximize thisacceleration, and use them to determine the underlying mechanisms ineach region. In the first regime, the inactive site stores a molecule inorder to release it following a reaction, when the neighboring catalyticsite is empty. In the second regime, the inactive site releases amolecule when the catalytic site is full, in order to impede themolecules from leaving the active site before they react.

Although tensile and compressivestrains have been known to control the amount of ripples, the effects ofstrain and ripple on the TC have not been decoupled. With the help ofGreen-Kubo simulations on larger graphene samples and simulations basedon the spectral energy density method on smaller samples withoutripples, we show that both samples show an approximately 30% decrease inTC between tensile strains 3% and 10% when ripples become negligibleeven in the larger sample. Between 0 and 3% strain, when both ripplesand strains are present in the larger sample, we decouple the effect ofripples from strain on the TC and show that ripples alone reduce the TCof the larger unstrained sample by approximately 61%. We also present aunique technique to introduce curvatures in the graphene sheetcontaining GBs by performing MD simulations under NPT ensembles with aconstant pressure of 200 bar along the x-axis. Our analysis suggeststhat the Green-Kubo TC linearly decreases with curvature; however, therate of decrease depends on the tilt angles of the grain boundary. Ananalysis of the TC in graphene samples with GBs of varying tilt anglesreveals that the TC strongly depends on the tilt angles. Thus, ourresearch underscores the pivotal role of ripple, curvature, and GB inmodulating the thermal conductivity of graphene.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01730"><em>arXiv:2501.01730</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3 id="enhanced-condensation-through-rotation">Enhanced CondensationThrough Rotation</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-0600:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Chernodub,+M">MaximChernodub</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wilczek,+F">FrankWilczek</a></span></p><p>We argue that the rotation of a thin superconducting cylinder canincrease the critical temperature of the superconducting phasetransition substantially.

Underliquid water conditions, the 1T' laminates, having a channel size of 6angstroms, achieved a peak power density of 2.0 mW m<spanclass="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span>, significantly outperforming the 2Hphase, lacking defined channels, that produced a power of 2.4 microWm<span class="math inline">\(^{-2}\)</span>.

In suchsystems, the contact line dynamics and the internal structure of thesuspension interact through shear-rate dependent viscosity and internalstructural rearrangements. The shear rate increases sharply near movingcontact lines, profoundly influencing the non-Newtonian rheology ofdense suspensions. Frictional contacts become significant as particlesapproach each other, forming force-carrying networks of contacts. Whilehydrodynamic solutions can describe dilute suspensions, theirapplicability near advancing contact lines in dense suspensions remainsunclear. This study explores such applicability by systematicallyvarying inter-particle interactions. We use silica suspensions in tworefractive-index matched media: (i) aqueous 2,<spanclass="math inline">\(2^{\prime}\)</span>-thiodiethanol (weakinteractions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (stronginteractions). The two samples vary substantially in their rheologicalresponse. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), weprecisely track the 3D motion of tracer particles within the suspension.To observe the drop over a long travel distance, we use a configurationconsisting of a pinned droplet on a moving substrate. We observedistinct behaviours depending on particle interactions and the resultingsuspension rheology. The more the particle interactions play a role,i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian effects, the stronger themeasured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian solution to thehydrodynamic equations. In case of the viscous suspension, a notabledeviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, theyield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, withNewtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near thesubstrate.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01762"><em>arXiv:2501.01762</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft)</span></p><h3id="energy-spectra-and-fluxes-of-two-dimensional-turbulent-quantum-droplets">Energyspectra and fluxes of two-dimensional turbulent quantum droplets</h3><p>New Submission | Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas) | 2025-01-0600:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jha,+S+K">ShawanKumar Jha</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Verma,+M+K">MahendraK.

The objects areconstructed from subunits (e.g. monomers). Each object is characterizedby the difference of self-instructed reproduction and decomposition rateonly. This difference, divided by a common dimensional constant, iscalled ``productivity''. Due to external influence the productivity ofeach object can randomly change. The system as a whole is subjected toexternal limitation: the total number of the objects is conserved (e.g.,by the controlled influx of monomers). We consider such process aspossibly simplest example of self-organization. We obtained exactsolutions of our model for several presumed mechanisms of random changeof the productivity.

However, only 25 % of the electronicstates (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emitlight, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significantattention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate oftriplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial todepopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to tripletsor interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecularbonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to addressthese issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities onecan couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the populationdynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned forPurcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photonshybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons.To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions andlight-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unifiedtheory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In thisarticle, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning thezero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different ratesusing Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the differentregimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficienciesin all cases.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01800"><em>arXiv:2501.01800</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">13 pages, 3 figures, 1table</span></p><h3id="reconfigurable-filamentary-conduction-in-thermally-stable-zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-zif-8-resistive-switching-devices">ReconfigurableFilamentary Conduction in Thermally Stable Zeolitic ImidazolateFramework (ZIF-8) Resistive Switching Devices</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0600:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kaushik,+D">DivyaKaushik</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kumar,+N">NitinKumar</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sharma,+H">HarshitSharma</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Prajapat,+P">PukhrajPrajapat</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=V.,+M">MehamaliniV.</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=G.Sambandamurthy">G.Sambandamurthy</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ritu">RituSrivastava</a></span></p><p>The rapid growth of digital technology has driven the need forefficient storage solutions, positioning memristors as promisingcandidates for next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) due to theirsuperior electrical properties.

In this study, we present a resistive random-accessmemory (ReRAM) device utilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8),a MOF material, as the resistive switching layer.

Recent experimentalcapabilities to measure the full distribution of quantum states inHilbert space and the emergence of specific state ensembles haveextended this to questions of {}, by introducing the notion of the {} --ensembles of pure states of a subsystem obtained by projectivemeasurements on its complement. While previous work examined chaoticunitary circuits, Hamiltonian evolution, and systems with globalconserved charges, we study the projected ensemble in systems wherethere are an extensive number of conserved charges all of which have(quasi)local support. We employ a strongly disordered quantum spin chainwhich shows many-body localized dynamics over long timescales as well asthe <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-bit model, aphenomenological archetype of a many-body localized system, with thecharges being <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-local in thelatter. In particular, we discuss the dependence of the projectedensemble on the measurement basis. Starting with random direct productstates, we find that the projected ensemble constructed fromtime-evolved states converges to a Scrooge ensemble at late times and inthe large system limit except when the measurement operator is close tothe conserved charges. This is in contrast to systems with globalconserved charges where the ensemble varies continuously with themeasurement basis.

Yet, training physical neural networks aredifficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. Anemerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learningthat uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Underexternal inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by thenatural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modernlearning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating therequirements on external computation this http URL, we demonstrate areal spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) andunsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution ofphysical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix astrainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, theconductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithmin a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and canachieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. Thefast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer anadvantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly inmaterials.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01853"><em>arXiv:2501.01853</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Disordered Systems and NeuralNetworks (cond-mat.dis-nn), Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">21 pages, 5figures</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Proc.

We demonstrate that quantum network nonlocality can still bedemonstrated in such a setting, hence exhibiting topological robustness.Specifically, we present quantum distributions obtained from a simplenetwork that cannot be reproduced by classical models, even when thelatter are based on more powerful networks. In particular, we show thatin a large ring network, the knowledge of only a small part of thenetwork structure (involving only two or three neighboring parties) isenough to guarantee nonlocality over the entire network. This shows thatquantum network nonlocality can be extremely robust to changes in thenetwork topology.

Here, by developing a decoherence-free approach, we generateintense femtosecond-duration infrared coherent state superpositions(CSSs) with a mean photon number orders of magnitude higher than theexisting CSS sources. We utilize them in nonlinear optics to drive thesecond harmonic generation process in an optical crystal. Weexperimentally and theoretically show that the nonclassical nature ofthe intense infrared CSS is imprinted in the second-orderautocorrelation traces. Additionally, theoretical analysis shows thatthe quantum features of the infrared CSS are also present in thegenerated second harmonic.

Inthis work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclearquantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case.This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates.

Because of the noncollinearmagnetic order, the localized electron spins on different magneticsublattices are not conserved even when spin-orbit coupling isneglected, making it difficult to understand the transport of spinangular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether current due tospin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in noncollinear AFMs.Interestingly, we find that a Hall component of the spin current can begenerically created by a longitudinal driving force associated with apropagating spin wave, inherently distinguishing noncollinear AFMs fromcollinear ones. We coin the corresponding Hall coefficient, an isotropicrank-four tensor, as the Hall (inverse) mass, which generally exists innoncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. The resulting Hall spincurrent can be realized by spin pumping in a ferromagnet-noncollinearAFM bilayer structure as we demonstrate numerically, for which we alsogive the criteria of ideal boundary conditions.

Theproximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inheritssuperconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of suchhybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect inhole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precisemechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlationsremains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complexstrong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses toelectric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance ofunderstanding the interplay between such effects and the proximityeffect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus ongermanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop aneffective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extractvarious analytical expressions and predict different types ofsuperconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet andtriplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as wellas different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, togetherwith their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows usto make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence off-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimescaused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00088"><em>arXiv:2501.00088</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Superconductivity(cond-mat.supr-con)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">13 pages, 9 figures, plusAppendices</span></p><h3id="evidence-for-a-mathbbz_2-dirac-spin-liquid-in-the-generalized-shastry-sutherland-model">Evidencefor a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\)</span> Dirac spinliquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Maity,+A">AtanuMaity</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ferrari,+F">FrancescoFerrari</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee,+J+Y">JongYeon Lee</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Potten,+J">JanikPotten</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=M%C3%BCller,+T">TobiasMüller</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Thomale,+R">RonnyThomale</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Samajdar,+R">RhineSamajdar</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Iqbal,+Y">YasirIqbal</a></span></p><p>We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of therecently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-<spanclass="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> Heisenberg antiferromagnet on theShastry-Sutherland lattice.

We discovered thatstreaming conductance becomes pressure dependent in Angstrom channelsusing latent track membranes. The streaming current emerges only whenthe applied pressure exceeds a threshold value, which is inconsistentwith the existing knowledge as a constant. With increasing channel size,we found that the pressure dependent streaming conductance phenomenonweakens and vanishes into a constant streaming conductance regime whenthe mean channel radius exceeds 2 nm. The effective surface potentialderived from the stream conductance that divides conduction anomalouslyincreases as the channel narrows. We suspect the pressure dependentstreaming current is due to the reinforced Coulomb interaction betweencounterions and deprotonated carboxyl groups at the surface, which isclose to the ion channel but different from the electrified 2Dmaterials. The streaming current emerged due to hydrodynamic frictionwhen the counterions were released from the surface.

Overall, the manuscriptoutlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i)downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii)extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00333"><em>arXiv:2501.00333</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">20 pages, 7 figures, 150references</span></p><h3id="the-simplest-spin-glass-revisited-finite-size-effects-of-the-energy-landscape-can-modify-aging-dynamics-in-the-thermodynamic-limit">Thesimplest spin glass revisited: finite-size effects of the energylandscape can modify aging dynamics in the thermodynamic limit</h3><p>New Submission | Disordered Systems and Neural Networks(cond-mat.dis-nn) | 2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+B">BinLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jin,+Y">YuliangJin</a></span></p><p>The random energy model is one of the few glass models whoseasymptotic activated aging dynamics are solvable. However, the existingaging theory, i.e., Bouchaud's trap model, does not agree with dynamicalsimulation results obtained in finite-sized systems. Here we show thatthis discrepancy originates from non-negligible finite-size correctionsin the energy barrier distributions. The finite-size effects add alogarithmic decay term in the time-correlation aging function, whichdestroys the asymptotic large-time plateau predicted by Bouchaud's trapmodel in the spin glass phase. Surprisingly, the finite-size effectsalso give corrections, preserved even in the thermodynamic limit, to thevalue of the asymptotic plateau. It results in an unexpected dynamicaltransition where weak ergodicity breaking occurs, at a temperature <spanclass="math inline">\(T_{\rm d}\)</span> above the thermodynamicspin-glass transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{\rmc}\)</span>. Based on the barrier distributions obtained by a numericalbarrier-tree method and an expansion theory, we propose a generalizedtrap model to incorporate such finite-size effects. The theoreticallyderived aging behavior of the generalized trap model explains theMonte-Carlo dynamical simulation data of random energy models withGaussian and exponential random energies. Our results suggest that thedouble limits of large system size and long time are not interchangeablefor the activated aging dynamics.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338"><em>arXiv:2501.00338</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Disordered Systems and NeuralNetworks (cond-mat.dis-nn)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">19 pages, 20figures</span></p><h3id="density-of-electronic-states-in-density-wave-compounds-with-imperfect-nesting">Densityof electronic states in density-wave compounds with imperfectnesting</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tsvetkova,+A+V">A.V.

The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly relyon various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise todispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatialbroadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformationinevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components forinformation processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate thenonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moiré photoniclattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- orcounter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing twoidentical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the outputpattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localizationin the forward case is derived from the moiré structure, and thenonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity)are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. Thethermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent conditionfor electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case,because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of thecoupling field. The current work provides an approach to control thetransverse beam profile in one-way transmission.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00347"><em>arXiv:2501.00347</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Optics (physics.optics)</span></p><h3id="topic-review-hatsugai-kohmoto-models-exactly-solvable-playground-for-mottness-and-non-fermi-liquid">TopicReview: Hatsugai-Kohmoto models: Exactly solvable playground forMottness and Non-Fermi Liquid</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhao,+M">MiaomiaoZhao</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+W">Wei-WeiYang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhong,+Y">YinZhong</a></span></p><p>This pedagogic review aims to give a gentle introduction to anexactly solvable model, the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model, which hasinfinite-ranged interaction but conserves the center of mass.

Going beyond the phenomenologicalmodels and group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binaryexplanation of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, inthis work, we explored the role of crystal chemical bonding. As thelatter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and istunable, it provides a quantitative and more realistic mechanism toexplain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principlecalculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linearcombination of atomic orbitals on NiS, belonging to the hexagonal NiAsfamily (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.), we reveal that the second neighborinteraction between the orbitals of the non-magnetic atoms is the mostdeterministic in inducing altermagnetism. These second-neighbor bondingsmodulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the oppositespin sublattices. As a consequence, the antiferromagnetic sublatticeband degeneracy is lifted and it results in momentum dependentaltermagnetic spin split (ASS). We further reveal that the strongaltermagnetism is observed in these materials due to the participationof multiple and selective orbitals, both from Ni and S, in the chemicalbonding. We proposed twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonalcrystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increaseswith correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it cango beyond 1eV, which makes this compound ideal for carrying outaltermagnetic experiments and for exploring non-trivial quantumtransport through electron and hole doping. The present study opens upnew pathways to tailor tunable altermagnetism.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00453"><em>arXiv:2501.00453</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">12 pages, 10 figures, and 6tables</span></p><h3id="non-perturbative-self-consistent-electron-phonon-spectral-functions-and-transport">Non-perturbativeself-consistent electron-phonon spectral functions and transport</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lihm,+J">Jae-MoLihm</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ponc%C3%A9,+S">SamuelPoncé</a></span></p><p>Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectralfunctions and carrier transport properties.

Thedeveloped method can be widely applied to materials with dominantelectron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00468"><em>arXiv:2501.00468</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><h3id="on-the-wiedemann-franz-law-violation-in-graphene-and-quark-gluon-plasma-systems">Onthe Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasmasystems</h3><p>New Submission | Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) |2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dwibedi,+A">AshutoshDwibedi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Nayak,+S">SubhalaxmiNayak</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kiran,+S+S">SatheSubodh Kiran</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ghosh,+S">SabyasachiGhosh</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Vempati,+S">SeshaVempati</a></span></p><p>A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties ofthe ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ioncollisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-holeplasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that theenthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantitydetermining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratiois defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized bytemperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyedor violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, wefind that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based frameworkwill always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reasonis the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy perparticle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene,and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF lawviolation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high netcharge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermienergy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition ofthe graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, thefluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be exploredby future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) andNuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490"><em>arXiv:2501.00490</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Strongly Correlated Electrons(cond-mat.str-el), Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech), NuclearTheory (nucl-th)</span></p><h3id="angle-resolved-photoemission-of-topological-materials">Angle-resolvedphotoemission of topological materials</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=S%C3%A1nchez-Barriga,+J">JaimeSánchez-Barriga</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Clark,+O+J">OliverJ.

While the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase isgenerally recognized as unstable at lower temperatures, its stabilityrelative to the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at high temperatures(approximately 0.5 eV) in the Earth's inner core (IC) remains a topic ofongoing theoretical and experimental debate. Our ab initio calculationsshow a significant drop in energy, the emergence of a plateau and alocal minimum in the potential energy surface, and stabilization of allphonon modes at elevated electron temperatures (&gt;1-1.5 eV). Theseeffects increase the competition among the BCC, HCP, and theface-centered cubic (FCC) phases and lead to the metastability of theBCC structure. Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of BCC iron isenhanced by its substantial lattice vibration entropy. This thermallyinduced structural competitiveness and metastability undernon-equilibrium conditions provide a clear theoretical framework forunderstanding iron phase relations and solidification processes, bothexperimentally and in the IC.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00524"><em>arXiv:2501.00524</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">5 pages, 4 figures</span></p><h3id="non-reciprocal-neutral-ferroelectric-domain-walls-in-bifeo3">Non-reciprocalneutral ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO3</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Goncalves,+M+A+P">M.A. P.

Weidentify starch concentration as the key factor influencing saucestability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically,we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative tocheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a conditiondetermining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to anunpleasant and separated sauce.

Using a minimalrepresentation via a branching tree, we map this problem to the directedpolymer (DP) model on the Cayley tree, although in a regime dominated byrare events. By studying the Shannon entropy of the probabilitydistribution estimated by the observer, we demonstrate a phasetransition distinguishing a chaotic phase with reduced Lyapunov exponentfrom a strong-measurement phase where uncertainty remains bounded.Remarkably, the location of the MIPT transition coincides with thefreezing transition of the DP, although the critical properties differ.We provide an exact universal scaling function describing entropy growthin the critical regime.

Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-Jmodel in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properlyengineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction andinter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model withnext-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularlyexplore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime farbeyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates.

This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restrictedthermalization.

A <spanclass="math inline">\(C_{4}T\)</span> symmetry reverses the sign of<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> angle, hence seems toprotect a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span>classification of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\!=\!0,\pi\)</span>.However, we prove that, if <span class="math inline">\((C_{4}T)^4 \!=\!1\)</span>, the topological state with <spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\!=\!\pi\)</span> cannot be realized in bandinsulators where <span class="math inline">\(C_{4}T\)</span> is exact.Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), wefind that an STI with <spanclass="math inline">\(\theta\!=\!\pi\)</span> can arise in Andersoninsulators with disorders respecting <spanclass="math inline">\(C_{4}T\)</span> on average. To illustrate thisstate, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram usingthe transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessiblesystem size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surfacestates and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk.As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from bothclean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing theintrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STIis robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactionscannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped cleansystem. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT andits lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to othercrystalline symmetries.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00572"><em>arXiv:2501.00572</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Disordered Systems and Neural Networks(cond-mat.dis-nn)</span></p><h3id="efficient-training-of-machine-learning-potentials-for-metallic-glasses-cuzral-validation">Efficienttraining of machine learning potentials for metallic glasses: CuZrAlvalidation</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wadowski,+A">AntoniWadowski</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Parmar,+A+D">AnshulD.S.

Formetallic glasses, developing these potentials is challenging due to thecomplexity of their unique disordered structure. As a result,chemistry-specific interaction potentials for this important class ofmaterials are often missing. Here, we solve this gap by implementing anefficient methodology for designing machine learning interatomicpotentials (MLIPs) for metallic glasses, and we benchmark it with thewidely studied CuZrAl system. By combining a Lennard-Jones surrogatemodel with swap-Monte Carlo sampling and Density Functional Theory (DFT)corrections, we capture diverse amorphous structures from 14 decades ofsupercooling. These distinct structures provide robust and efficienttraining of the model and applicability to the wider spectrum ofenergies. This approach reduces the need for extensive DFT and ab initiooptimization datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. Our MLIP showsresults comparable to the classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) availablefor CuZrAl, in predicting structural, energetic, and mechanicalproperties. This work paves the way for the development of new MLIPs forcomplex metallic glasses, including emerging multicomponent and highentropy metallic glasses.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00589"><em>arXiv:2501.00589</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Disordered Systems and Neural Networks(cond-mat.dis-nn)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">9 pages, 5 figures</span></p><h3id="coexistence-of-commensurate-and-incommensurate-antiferromagnetic-groundstates-in-co_xnbse_2-single-crystal">Coexistenceof Commensurate and Incommensurate Antiferromagnetic Groundstates inCo<span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span>NbSe<spanclass="math inline">\(_2\)</span> Single Crystal</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Mandujano,+H+C">H.Cein Mandujano</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zavalij,+P+Y">PeterY.

A conceptual complication appears here, where both theexcitation and the ground syate ordering are built from theintermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic anddynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition aview of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of asemiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative.After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons canappear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interactingwith other degrees of freedom prone to an instability.

The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typicallyresided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, wepropose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate butis hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable,dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL isguaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirrorsymmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic andmagnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magneticlayer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirrorsymmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstratespinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror andtime-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbitalcoupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGshave also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical latticemodels to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specificelectronic fillings in real materials, namely 4<spanclass="math inline">\(N\)</span>+2 in spinless systems (and 2<spanclass="math inline">\(N\)</span>+1 in spinful systems), the presence ofthe HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of thesystems. Using calculations, we further identify possible materialcandidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinfulHENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic ofmomentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new typeof topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study therelated physics of HENLs.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00706"><em>arXiv:2501.00706</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics(cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="spin-hall-effect-in-3d-ferromagnetic-metals-for-field-free-switching-of-perpendicular-magnetization-a-first-principles-investigation">SpinHall effect in 3d ferromagnetic metals for field-free switching ofperpendicular magnetization: A first-principles investigation</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zheng,+F">FanxingZheng</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dong,+J">JiantingDong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Song,+Y">YizhuoSong</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhu,+M">MengZhu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Li,+X">XinluLi</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang,+J">JiaZhang</a></span></p><p>Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin currentwith unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offerpromising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicularmagnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices.

Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivitieswith out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are atthe order of 1000 ( , )^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spinHall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity.For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reachup to 10000 ( , )^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at roomtemperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, wedemonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetizationwithout an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals asspin current sources.

However, the vast majority of previous works concerned withMLZMs that were bounded to vortexes inside the bulk. Here in this work,we unveil the braiding rule of MLZMs that are tunable around theboundary of a vortex-texture Kekule modulated graphene. We show that theexistence of these zero-dimensional boundary MLZMs is protected by theZak phase of 1D boundary states. As such, we are able to constructmultiple MLZMs and analyze the corresponding braiding process. Inaddition, we also provide an implementation scheme of the boundary MLZMsin acoustic crystals.

Mechanical exfoliation using adhesive tape remains the dominantmethod for preparing 2D materials of highest quality, includingtransition metal dichalcogenides, but always results in small-sizedflakes. This limitation poses a significant challenge for investigationsand applications where large scale flakes are needed. To overcome theseconstraints, we explored the preparation of 2D WS2 and WSe2 using arecently developed kinetic in situ single-layer synthesis method (KISS).In particular, we focused on the influence of different substrates, Auand Ag, and chalcogen atoms, S and Se, on the yield and quality of the2D films. The crystallinity and spatial morphology of the 2D films werecharacterized using optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy,providing a comprehensive assessment of exfoliation quality. Low-energyelectron diffraction verified that there is no preferential orientationbetween the 2D film and the substrate, while optical microscopy revealedthat WSe2 consistently outperformed WS2 in producing large monolayers,regardless of the substrate used. Finally, X-ray diffraction and X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that no covalent bonds are formedbetween the 2D material and the underlying substrate.

We extend this formula todescribe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in theintermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based onthe derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss inthe current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in thegain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; theanomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; thepresence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductancescontinuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outsidethe energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomenain open systems.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844"><em>arXiv:2501.00844</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Disordered Systems and Neural Networks(cond-mat.dis-nn), Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas), StatisticalMechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><h3id="robustness-of-quantum-many-body-scars-in-the-presence-of-markovian-bath">Robustnessof quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</h3><p>New Submission | Disordered Systems and Neural Networks(cond-mat.dis-nn) | 2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jiang,+X">Xiang-PingJiang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Xu,+M">MingdiXu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+X">XuanpuYang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+Y">YuchengWang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Pan,+L">LeiPan</a></span></p><p>A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend tothermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial stateeventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. Aparadigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicitybreaking is known as many-body localization, where strongdisorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization.It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would bedelocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, thisconsequence recently has received challenges where an exoticdissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitionsbetween localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, wepromote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hostingquantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to asteady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibitdynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out anexperimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a coldatomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visibleover dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities forexperimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherentdynamics.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00886"><em>arXiv:2501.00886</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Disordered Systems and NeuralNetworks (cond-mat.dis-nn), Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas),Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech), Quantum Physics(quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">7+1 pages, 4+1 figures.Comments are welcome</span></p><h3id="is-a-phonon-excitation-of-a-superfluid-bose-gas-a-goldstone-boson">Isa phonon excitation of a superfluid Bose gas a Goldstone boson?</h3><p>New Submission | Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tomchenko,+M">MaksimTomchenko</a></span></p><p>It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas areGoldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking(SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of thesystem is invariant under the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span>transformation <spanclass="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}%\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\)</span>, whereas the order parameter <spanclass="math inline">\(\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\)</span> is not. However, thestrict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundaryconditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the isnot. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system ofspinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standardBogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, andthe approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our resultsshow that the answer to the question in the title is no. Thus, phononsin a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in aclassical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collectivevibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In thecase of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical:the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate ornon-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson anddifferent from it.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00893"><em>arXiv:2501.00893</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Quantum Gases(cond-mat.quant-gas), Quantum Physics (quant-ph)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">22 pages</span></p><h3id="understanding-memristive-behavior-an-atomistic-study-of-the-influence-of-grain-boundaries-on-surface-and-out-of-plane-diffusion-of-metallic-atoms">UnderstandingMemristive Behavior: An Atomistic Study of the Influence of GrainBoundaries on Surface and Out-of-Plane Diffusion of Metallic Atoms</h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ganeriwala,+M+D">MohitD.

Thisstudy presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration ofdifferent metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs,employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-EquilibriumGreen's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms,Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration bothin the out-of-plane direction through a MoS layer and along the surfaceof the MoS layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical andlateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually presentin MoS are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion ofmetal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristineMoS and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the keyelements that affect the switching performance of memristors.Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate theeffects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance,providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00904"><em>arXiv:2501.00904</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci), Applied Physics (physics.app-ph), ComputationalPhysics (physics.comp-ph)</span></p><h3id="achievable-information-energy-exchange-in-a-brownian-information-engine-through-potential-profiling">AchievableInformation-Energy Exchange in a Brownian Information Engine throughPotential Profiling</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Rafeek,+R">RafnaRafeek</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Mondal,+D">DebasishMondal</a></span></p><p>The information engine extracts work from a single heat bath usingmutual information obtained during the operation cycle. This studyinvestigates the influence of the potential shaping in a Brownianinformation engine (BIE) in harnessing the information from thermalfluctuations. We have designed a BIE by considering an overdampedBrownian particle inside a confined potential and introducing anappropriate symmetric feedback cycle. We find that the upper bound ofthe extractable work for a BIE with a monostable centrosymmetricconfining potential, with a stable state at the potential centre,depends on the bath temperature and the convexity of the confinement. Aconcave confinement is more efficient for an information-energyexchange. For a bistable confinement with an unstable centre and twosymmetric stable basins, one can find an engine-to-refrigerationtransition beyond a certain barrier height related to the energydifference between the energy barrier and the stable basins. Finally, weuse the concavity-induced gain in information harnessing to device a BIEin the presence of a multistable potential that can harvest even moreenergy than monostable confinement.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00918"><em>arXiv:2501.00918</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft)</span></p><h3id="anisotropic-raman-scattering-and-lattice-orientation-identification-of-2m-ws2">AnisotropicRaman scattering and lattice orientation identification of 2M-WS2</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gautam,+S">SabinGautam</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Mardanya,+S">SougataMardanya</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=McBride,+J">JosephMcBride</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hossain,+A+K+M+M">AK M Manjur Hossain</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Yang,+Q">QianYang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wang,+W">WenyongWang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ackerman,+J">JohnAckerman</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Leonard,+B+M">BrianM.

Weestablish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectraand high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, wedemonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determinethe crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2layers.

Neuralnetworks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertaintyquantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. FullyBayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probabilitydistributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods,offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost.Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), whereonly selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remaindeterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on activelearning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lowercomputational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributionswith weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstratethat PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions toaccelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate theseapproaches on both molecular property prediction and materials sciencetasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning withlimited, complex datasets.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00952"><em>arXiv:2501.00952</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Disordered Systems and NeuralNetworks (cond-mat.dis-nn), Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci), DataAnalysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)</span></p><h3id="new-insights-into-the-dependence-of-glass-transition-temperature-and-dynamic-fragility-on-molecular-weight-in-oligomers-and-polymers">NewInsights into the Dependence of Glass Transition Temperature and DynamicFragility on Molecular Weight in Oligomers and Polymers</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ginzburg,+V+V">ValeriyV.

V. Ginzburg, O. V. Gendelman, R. Casalini,and A. Zaccone, arXiv:2409.17291), we demonstrated that the dynamic(relaxation time) and volume equations of state for many amorphouspolymers are near-universal -- each material is characterized by twogoverning parameters -- the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, and theelementary relaxation time, /tau_{el}. The dynamic fragility, m, isuniquely related to /tau_{el}. The earlier analysis was based on thedata for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N &gt; 200, andmolecular weight, Mw &gt; 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate thedependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on themolecular weight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data forhomologous series of four polymers: polystyrene (PS),poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), andpolybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the relaxation time curves forvarious oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto the same mastercurve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature and thedynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreementwith the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted basedon the SL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistentwith the Boyer rules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above andbelow T_{g}, as well as the thermodynamical scaling for the pressuredependence of the relaxation time.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00956"><em>arXiv:2501.00956</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Soft Condensed Matter(cond-mat.soft)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">14 pages, 3 figures, 1table</span></p><h3 id="optical-signatures-of-euler-superconductors">Optical signaturesof Euler superconductors</h3><p>New Submission | Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Chau,+C+W">ChunWang Chau</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Jankowski,+W+J">WojciechJ.

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides acomplete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds arerecently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we presentan exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decomposesystem response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events.This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded incorrelations between transitions and dwelling times across the network,providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipationtheorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifiesexisting response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, andreveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness ofmulti-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoreticalsignificance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation ofresponse properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practicaladvantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far fromequilibrium.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01050"><em>arXiv:2501.01050</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Statistical Mechanics(cond-mat.stat-mech), Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)</span></p><h3id="fluctuations-of-topological-charges-in-two-dimensional-classical-heisenberg-model">Fluctuationsof topological charges in two-dimensional classical Heisenbergmodel</h3><p>New Submission | Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech) |2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Tang,+S">Shan-ChangTang</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Shi,+Y">YuShi</a></span></p><p>Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phasetransition in two-dimensional XY model.

Theinfluence of a boundary is largely determined by its energy. Grainboundary energy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundaryparameters representing grain misorientation and boundary planeinclination. In grain boundary simulation and modeling, many studiesneglect structural multiplicity of boundaries, i.e., existence ofmetastable states, and focus on minimum energy. The minimum energyfunction restricted to constant misorientation should satisfy Herring'scondition for interface stability. This requirement has been ignored inrecent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example violations ofthe stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and naturalprocedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying thecondition is described. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundaryplane inclinations arise because of the imposition of the stabilitycondition, and their locations and shapes result from properties ofinput data. An example of applying the procedure to simulated data ispresented.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01175"><em>arXiv:2501.01175</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Materials Science(cond-mat.mtrl-sci)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">19 pages, 8 figures, 34references</span></p><h3id="pyramidal-charged-domain-walls-in-ferroelectric-bifeo_3">Pyramidalcharged domain walls in ferroelectric BiFeO<spanclass="math inline">\(_3\)</span></h3><p>New Submission | Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Marton,+P">PavelMarton</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Pa%C5%9Bciak,+M">MarekPaściak</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gon%C3%A7alves,+M">MauroGonçalves</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Nov%C3%A1k,+O">OndřejNovák</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hlinka,+J">JiříHlinka</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Beanland,+R">RichardBeanland</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Alexe,+M">MarinAlexe</a></span></p><p>Domain structures play a crucial role in the electric, mechanical andother properties of ferroelectric materials.

While water dynamics remains largely classical under extremeconfinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling betweenwater transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confiningmaterials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamicflows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin tocondensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination ofmany-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquidcan induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at oddswith the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that therange of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid'selectronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are atresonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnellingis expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidicnetworks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It furthersuggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls formanipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature andcharacteristics of individual molecules.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01253"><em>arXiv:2501.01253</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall), Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft),Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)</span></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Nature Nanotechnology(2025)</span></p><h3id="heitler-effect-and-resonance-fluorescence-in-quantum-magnonics">Heitlereffect and resonance fluorescence in quantum magnonics</h3><p>New Submission | Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)| 2025-01-03 00:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ilbu%C4%9Fa,+E">EnesIlbuğa</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dobrovitski,+V+V">V.V.

We conclude that band reconstruction isessential for the broad class of network models recently introduced todescribe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01337"><em>arXiv:2501.01337</em>(2025)</a></p><p><span style="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Mesoscale and NanoscalePhysics (cond-mat.mes-hall)</span></p><h3id="close-contact-melting-on-hydrophobic-textured-surfaces-confinement-and-meniscus-effects">Close-contactmelting on hydrophobic textured surfaces: Confinement and meniscuseffects</h3><p>New Submission | Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft) | 2025-01-0300:00 EST</p><p><spanstyle="color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Hu,+N">NanHu</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Fan,+L">LiwuFan</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Gao,+X">XiangGao</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Stone,+H+A">HowardA.

In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions andthus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and moreversatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensionalQAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish itsbulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via thedistinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that thethree-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatialdirection while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction,and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermienergy. These two types of boundary states are further connected througha perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermienergy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction,its Hall resistance can quantize to <spanclass="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <spanclass="math inline">\(h/e^2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\pmh/e^2\)</span> when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutralpoint.
