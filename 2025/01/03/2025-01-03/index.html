<p>We discuss quantum network Bell nonlocality in a setting where the
network structure is not fully known. More concretely, an honest user
may trust their local network topology, but not the structure of the
rest of the network, involving distant (and potentially dishonest)
parties. We demonstrate that quantum network nonlocality can still be
demonstrated in such a setting, hence exhibiting topological robustness.
Specifically, we present quantum distributions obtained from a simple
network that cannot be reproduced by classical models, even when the
latter are based on more powerful networks. In particular, we show that
in a large ring network, the knowledge of only a small part of the
network structure (involving only two or three neighboring parties) is
enough to guarantee nonlocality over the entire network. This shows that
quantum network nonlocality can be extremely robust to changes in the
network topology. Moreover, we demonstrate that applications of quantum
nonlocality, such as the black-box certification of randomness and
entanglement, are also possible in such a setting.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed by Cabello in a theoretical Letter [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 127, 070401 (2021)] that nonlocality and contextuality, as
two intuitively distinctive yet both critical quantum resources, can be
surprisingly connected through Bell inequalities associated with
state-independent contextuality sets. It provides a general unified
method capable of converting contextuality into bipartite nonlocality.
However, experimental tests of the inequalities are challenging and
noise sensitive, and the requirements for the quantum states purity,
dimensionality, and degree of entanglement have blocked the experimental
implementation. We report a first experimental test of Cabello's
inequalities from state-independent contextuality sets, by leveraging
two-photon high-dimensional orbital angular momentum entangled states.
Distinguishing from the standard single-particle ways, our experiment
spotlights that the state-independent contextuality sets can be tested
in a bipartite scenario, by which the ''compatibility'' or ''sharpness''
loopholes can be effectively avoided. Our results provide a new
perspective and demonstrate the principle that contextuality, a widely
used quantum resource, can be used in different physical scenarios.</p>

<p>Dual-type qubits have become a promising way to suppress the
crosstalk error of auxiliary operations in large-scale ion trap quantum
computation. Here we demonstrate a direct entangling gate between
dual-type qubits encoded in the <span
class="math inline">\({S}_{1/2}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\({D}_{5/2}\)</span> hyperfine manifolds of <span
class="math inline">\(^{137}{\mathrm{Ba}}^{+}\)</span> ions. Our scheme
is economic in the hardware, requiring only a single 532 nm laser system
to entangle both qubit types by driving their Raman transitions. We
achieve a Bell state fidelity of 96.3(4)% for the dual-type
Molmer-Sorensen gate between an <span class="math inline">\(S\text{-
}D\)</span> ion pair, comparable to that for the same-type <span
class="math inline">\(S\text{- }S\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(D\text{- }D\)</span> gates. This technique can
reduce the overhead for back-and-forth conversions between dual-type
qubits in the quantum circuit with wide applications in quantum error
correction and ion-photon quantum networks.</p>

<p>Conformal Regge theory predicts the existence of analytically
continued conformal field theory data for complex spin. How could this
work when there are so many more operators with large spin compared to
small spin? Using planar <span class="math inline">\(N=4\)</span> SYM as
a test ground, we find a simple physical picture. Operators do organize
themselves into analytic families but the continuation of the higher
families have zeros in their structure operator product expansion
constants for lower integer spins. They thus decouple. Newton's
interpolation series technique is perfectly suited to this physical
problem and will allow us to explore the complex spin half-plane.</p>

<p>We report on a major milestone in the construction of logarithmically
accurate final-state parton showers, achieving
next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for the wide class
of observables known as event shapes. The key to this advance lies in
the identification of the relation between critical NNLL analytic
resummation ingredients and their parton-shower counterparts. Our
analytic discussion is supplemented with numerical tests of the
logarithmic accuracy of three shower variants for more than a dozen
distinct event-shape observables in <span
class="math inline">\(Z\rightarrow q\overline{q}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Higgs}\rightarrow gg\)</span> decays. The
NNLL terms are phenomenologically sizeable, as illustrated in
comparisons to data.</p>

<p>Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected
to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates
for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large
magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be
strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip
collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed
of the two lowest Zeeman states of <span
class="math inline">\(^{162}\mathrm{Dy}\)</span> atoms, that act as dark
states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show
that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic
processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold
law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing
the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-wave interaction between
these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility
range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</p>

technologies. However, restrictions in existing state preparation and
characterization schemes, in combination with decoherence effects,
prevent their intensity enhancement and implementation in nonlinear
optics. Here, by developing a decoherence-free approach, we generate
intense femtosecond-duration infrared coherent state superpositions
(CSSs) with a mean photon number orders of magnitude higher than the
existing CSS sources. We utilize them in nonlinear optics to drive the
second harmonic generation process in an optical crystal. We
experimentally and theoretically show that the nonclassical nature of
the intense infrared CSS is imprinted in the second-order
autocorrelation traces. Additionally, theoretical analysis shows that
the quantum features of the infrared CSS are also present in the
generated second harmonic. The findings introduce the optical CSS into
the realm of nonlinear quantum optics, opening up new paths in quantum
information science and quantum light engineering by creating
nonclassical light states in various spectral regions via nonlinear
up-conversion processes.</p>

<p>A novel method is presented for generating radiation using the beat
wave of a bifrequency laser pulse to excite plasma oscillations in a
plasma slab that has a density gradient. The plasma wave is localized
where it is excited resonantly and becomes a plasma oscillator that
produces a beam of radially polarized, terahertz radiation.
Particle-in-cell simulations and a theoretical analysis are used to
demonstrate its main characteristics, such as its narrow bandwidth. The
radiator should have useful applications including driving
terahertz-band particle accelerators and for pump-probe experiments.</p>

<p>This Letter explores the stability of disconnections

introduce interfacial defect diagrams, derived from atomistic
simulations and segregation theory, to predict the stability of
disconnections in the temperature-solute concentration phase space and
relate it to governing segregation mechanisms. These diagrams reveal
multiple stability regimes influenced by solute-induced clustering and
pinning effects impacting the thermal migration of disconnections and
offering insights into their thermodynamics and kinetic properties.</p>

<p>Recent progress in the understanding of the collective behavior of
electrons and ions has revealed new types of ferroic orders beyond
ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, such as the ferroaxial state. The
latter retains only rotational symmetry around a single axis and
reflection symmetry with respect to a single mirror plane, both of which
are set by an emergent electric toroidal dipole moment. Because of this
unusual symmetry-breaking pattern, it has been challenging to directly
measure the ferroaxial order parameter, despite the increasing attention
this state has drawn. Here, we show that off-diagonal components of the
piezoresistivity tensor (i.e., the linear change in resistivity under
strain) transform the same way as the ferroaxial moments, providing a
direct probe of such order parameters. We identify two new proper
ferroaxial materials through a materials database search, and use
first-principles calculations to evaluate the piezoconductivity of the
double-perovskite <span

connection to ferroaxial order and to octahedral rotation modes.</p>

<p>Elucidating spin correlations in the parent compounds of

superconductivity. We used neutron scattering to study spin correlations
in <span class="math inline">\({\mathrm{Li}}_{1-

reduced electron carriers compared to its superconducting counterpart
(<span class="math inline">\({T}_{c}=41\text{ }\text{

findings show a reduced total fluctuating moment in this insulator
relative to FeSe and 122 iron pnictides, likely due to increased
interlayer distances from intercalation, which enhance fluctuations and
reduce the intensity of spin excitations. Moreover, we observed a
V-shaped spin wavelike excitation dispersion, contrasting with the
twisted hourglass pattern in the superconducting counterpart. Electron
doping shifts spin excitation from <span class="math inline">\((\pi

transition from V-shaped to hourglasslike dispersion, akin to behaviors
in hole-doped cuprates, suggests a potential shared mechanism in
magnetism and superconductivity across these diverse systems.</p>

<p>Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently
excited circular phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers,
opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in
functional materials. While the phonon Zeeman effect enables a
theoretical description of phonon-induced magnetism, it lacks efficient
angular momentum transfer from the phonon to the electron sector. In
this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear
quantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case.
This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wave
function under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An
excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between
electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. First-principles
simulations on <span class="math inline">\({\mathrm{SrTiO}}_{3}\)</span>
demonstrate that in parts of the Brillouin zone, this splitting between
orbitals carrying angular momentum can easily reach 50 meV.</p>

<p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) have recently attracted
attention in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics because
of their various interesting properties. Because of the noncollinear
magnetic order, the localized electron spins on different magnetic
sublattices are not conserved even when spin-orbit coupling is
neglected, making it difficult to understand the transport of spin
angular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether current due to
spin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in noncollinear AFMs.
Interestingly, we find that a Hall component of the spin current can be
generically created by a longitudinal driving force associated with a
propagating spin wave, inherently distinguishing noncollinear AFMs from
collinear ones. We coin the corresponding Hall coefficient, an isotropic
rank-four tensor, as the Hall (inverse) mass, which generally exists in
noncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. The resulting Hall spin
current can be realized by spin pumping in a ferromagnet-noncollinear
AFM bilayer structure as we demonstrate numerically, for which we also
give the criteria of ideal boundary conditions. Our results shed light
on the potential of noncollinear AFMs in manipulating the polarization
and flow of spin currents in general spintronic devices.</p>

<p>To reduce costs and delays related to developing new and effective
drugs, there is a critical need for improved human liver tissue models.
Here we describe an approach for 3D bioprinting functional human liver
tissue models, in which we fabricate disc-shaped structures (discoids)
200 {}m in thickness and 1-3 mm in diameter, embedded in a highly
permeable support medium made from packed microgels. We demonstrate that
the method is precise, accurate, and scalable; up to 100 tissues per
hour can be manufactured with a variability and error in diameter of
about 4%. Histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of printed discs
reveal self-organization, cell cohesion, and key liver marker
expression. During the course of 3-4 weeks in culture, the tissues
stably synthesize albumin and urea at high levels, outperforming
spheroid tissue models. We find the tissues express more than 100 genes
associated with molecular absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
excretion (ADME) at levels within the range of human liver. The liver
tissue models exhibit enzymatic formation of metabolites after exposure
to multiple test compounds. Together, these results demonstrate the
promise of 3D printed discoids for pharmacological and toxicological
applications.</p>

<p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great
deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for
quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The
proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits
superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such
hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in
hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise
mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations
remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex
strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to
electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of
understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity
effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on
germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an
effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract
various analytical expressions and predict different types of
superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and
triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well
as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together
with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us
to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of
f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes
caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p>

Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon

correlators between a gapless (Dirac) <span

<p>Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is
pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed
matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of
Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an
accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing
its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we
discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau
levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on
superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon
coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive
significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in
quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and
potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued
exploration in this rapidly developing field.</p>

<p>We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds
the quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally
reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the quantum metric, and
provides an explicit lower bound of the quantum metric due to the
time-reversal protected <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> index,
answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower
bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized
by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole <span
class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> index. As physical consequences of
the <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> bound, we show that the
time-reversal <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> index bounds
superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the
direct gap of a band insulator from above.</p>

<p>The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical
behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary
alloys. Density functional theory (DFT)-based methods provide a powerful
mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic
tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and
relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using density functional
perturbation theory (DFPT), for a comprehensive set of structural
refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo),
niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). Intermediate quantities
(force-response internal-strain tensor, <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, and displacement-response
internal-strain tensor, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>)
needed to compute the relaxed-ion elastic tensor are used here to map
heterogeneity in elastic constants at each lattice site in a given alloy
and associated relaxation fields. Derived polycrystalline aggregate
properties -- the bulk modulus (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>),
shear modulus (<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>), Young's modulus
(<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>), and Poisson's ratio (<span
class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>) and elastic anisotropy -- are
reported as a function of composition for all binaries. Pugh's ratio
(<span class="math inline">\(B/G\)</span>) and the Cauchy pressure
(<span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span>) derived from computed
elastic moduli are analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of alloying
on the mechanical properties of the refractory BCC binary alloys. The
computed mechanical properties data for the parent unary materials and
binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions
are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. These
results, together with computed microscopic field data, establish a
foundation for the principled design of compositionally-complex,
high-temperature-structural refractory alloys with desired elastic
properties.</p>

<p>Phase stabilization continues to be a critical issue in hafnium oxide
(HfO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>) due to the interdependence
of various contributing factors. Using first-principles calculations, we
analyze the effects of strain and doping on stabilizing the
ferroelectric phase. We found that combining Y-doping, O-vacancy, and
compressive biaxial strain, particularly in the (111) orientation,
offers an optimal pathway for stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of
HfO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>. Analysis of structural
coordination reveals how compressive strain affects phase competition.
Crystallography analysis provides insights into the advantage of the
(111) strain orientation compared to the (001) orientation. The impact
of dopants is discussed in the context of these findings.</p>

<p>The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> formation in diamond is especially
important as the Sn<span class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> color center
has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared
to the N<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and to other Group IV
color centers. The typical formation of the Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> involves placing Sn in diamond by ion
implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> species requires an additional
complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated
with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively,
producing the Sn<span class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> charge state
using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less
energetically favorable than having the Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> receive an electron from a
neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N<span
class="math inline">\(_\text{C}\)</span>) is always present in even the
purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron
donation by N<span class="math inline">\(_\text{C}\)</span> has been
proposed by Collins for charging the N<span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in diamond and it has been used to
interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper we use DFT
to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> charge state due to electron donation
arising from the presence of N<span
class="math inline">\(_\text{C}\)</span> in the host diamond.
Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each
of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> throughout each of the pathways. The
importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the
yield of charged states like the Sn<span
class="math inline">\(V^-\)</span> in diamond for transformative
applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.</p>

<p>A knowledge gap exists for flows and transport phenomena at the
Angstrom scale when the Poisson Nernst Planck equation based on the
concept of electrical double layer (EDL) fails. We discovered that
streaming conductance becomes pressure dependent in Angstrom channels
using latent track membranes. The streaming current emerges only when
the applied pressure exceeds a threshold value, which is inconsistent
with the existing knowledge as a constant. With increasing channel size,
we found that the pressure dependent streaming conductance phenomenon
weakens and vanishes into a constant streaming conductance regime when
the mean channel radius exceeds 2 nm. The effective surface potential
derived from the stream conductance that divides conduction anomalously
increases as the channel narrows. We suspect the pressure dependent
streaming current is due to the reinforced Coulomb interaction between
counterions and deprotonated carboxyl groups at the surface, which is
close to the ion channel but different from the electrified 2D
materials. The streaming current emerged due to hydrodynamic friction
when the counterions were released from the surface. We approximated the
stochastic process of counterion dissociation by 1D Kramer escape theory
framework and defined the Damkohler Number to describe the transition
from nonlinear streaming conductance regime to linear regime as
functions of applied pressure and channel radius and well explained the
enhanced effective surface potential in confinement.</p>

<p>Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle
algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the
<span class="math inline">\(\nu=1/2\)</span> fractional Chern insulator
(FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The
magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor,
acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with
increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at
the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight
of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition
while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the
graviton mode around <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point
of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density
correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is
chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the
graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our
results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral
graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the
on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moiré materials.</p>

<p>Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and
electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively
described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons
within 2D materials featuring twisted moiré structures. The interaction
between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives
rise to rich polaritons with moiré characteristics. We observe the
polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators.
Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we
confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of
moiré polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response,
offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.</p>

<p>We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional
superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. In
the Voigt geometry, an ultrathin superconducting film is fully
penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus
modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the
condensate. We provide an alternative interpretation of the recent
experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by
Lee et al. [1] which describes better their data for magnetic field
above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we analyze the terahertz
conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the
Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions
within a superconducting matrix. Moreover, we effectively account for
ubiquitous pair-conserving and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking
disorder scattering processes using the model of Herman and Hlubina
[2].</p>

<p>Patterned magnetic nanostructures are advanced materials
characterized by their unique magnetic properties at the nanoscale,
which are the result of tailored geometric configurations and
compositional engineering. As interest in nanotechnology continues to
grow exponentially, the exploration of patterned magnetic nanostructures
turns into a vibrant and critical area of study for both industry
professionals and academic researchers. Here, we review investigations
of standing spin waves (collective spin precessions) in magnetic
elements by the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The
presentation encompasses earlier studies of arrays of magnetic nanodisks
and nanoringes by cavity-based FMR as well as more recent studies of
individual nanodisks and 3D nanovolcanoes by a broadband FMR method
which implies the use of a coplanar waveguide. Overall, the manuscript
outlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i)
downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii)
extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.</p>

<p>The random energy model is one of the few glass models whose
asymptotic activated aging dynamics are solvable. However, the existing
aging theory, i.e., Bouchaud's trap model, does not agree with dynamical
simulation results obtained in finite-sized systems. Here we show that
this discrepancy originates from non-negligible finite-size corrections
in the energy barrier distributions. The finite-size effects add a
logarithmic decay term in the time-correlation aging function, which
destroys the asymptotic large-time plateau predicted by Bouchaud's trap
model in the spin glass phase. Surprisingly, the finite-size effects
also give corrections, preserved even in the thermodynamic limit, to the
value of the asymptotic plateau. It results in an unexpected dynamical
transition where weak ergodicity breaking occurs, at a temperature <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\rm d}\)</span> above the thermodynamic
spin-glass transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{\rm
c}\)</span>. Based on the barrier distributions obtained by a numerical
barrier-tree method and an expansion theory, we propose a generalized
trap model to incorporate such finite-size effects. The theoretically
derived aging behavior of the generalized trap model explains the
Monte-Carlo dynamical simulation data of random energy models with
Gaussian and exponential random energies. Our results suggest that the
double limits of large system size and long time are not interchangeable
for the activated aging dynamics.</p>

<p>We study the effects of imperfect nesting in a simple 2D
tight-binding model on the electronic properties in the density-wave
(DW) state. The discussed model reflects the main features of quasi-1D
metals, where the DW emerges. We show that an imperfect nesting leads to
unusual singularities in the quasi-particle density of states, leading
to a strong renormalization of the superconducting critical temperature.
We also compute the conductivity tensor of the normal state and obtain a
satisfactory agreement with the experimental data on rare-earth
tritellurides and many other DW materials.</p>

<p>Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent
backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical
information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely
on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to
dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial
broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation
inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for
information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the
nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moiré photonic
lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or
counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two
identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output
pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization
in the forward case is derived from the moiré structure, and the
nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity)
are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The
thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition
for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case,
because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the
coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the
transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.</p>

<p>This pedagogic review aims to give a gentle introduction to an
exactly solvable model, the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model, which has
infinite-ranged interaction but conserves the center of mass. Although
this model is invented in 1992, intensive studies on its properties
ranging from unconventional superconductivity, topological ordered
states to non-Fermi liquid behaviors are made since 2020. We focus on
its emergent non-Fermi liquid behavior and provide discussion on its
thermodynamics, single-particle and two-particle correlation functions.
Perturbation around solvable limit has also been explored with the help
of perturbation theory, renormalization group and exact diagonalization
calculation. We hope the present review will be helpful for graduate
students or researchers interested in HK-like models or more generic
strongly correlated electron systems.</p>

<p>In this study, the spin-orbit torque (SOT) in light metal oxide
systems is investigated using an experimental approach based on harmonic
Hall voltage techniques in out-of-plane (OOP) angular geometry for
samples with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In parallel, an analytical
derivation of this alternative OOP harmonic Hall detection geometry has
been developed, followed by experimental validation to extract SOT
effective fields. In addition, to accurately quantifying SOT, this
method allows complete characterization of thermoelectric effects,
opening promising avenues for accurate SOT characterization in related
systems. In particular, this study corroborates the critical role of
naturally oxidized copper interfaced with metallic Cu in the generation
of orbital current in Co(2)|Pt(4)|CuOx(3), demonstrating a two-fold
increase in damping-like torques compared to a reference sample with an
oxidized Al capping layer. These findings offer promising directions for
future research on the application aspect of non-equilibrium orbital
angular momentum.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the generation of diverse material flow regimes in
nematic liquid cells as driven by time-variable active surface
anchoring, including no-net flow, oscillatory flow, steady flow, and
pulsating flow. Specifically, we numerically simulate a passive nematic
fluid inside a cell bounded with two flat solid boundaries at which the
time-dependent anchoring is applied with the dynamically variable
surface anchoring easy axis. We show that different flow regimes emerge
as the result of different anchoring driving directions (i.e.
co-rotating or counter-rotating) and relative phase of anchoring
driving. The flow magnitude is tunable by cell thickness and anchoring
driving frequency. More generally, this work aims towards possible
applications of responsive time-variable surfaces, including photonics
or synthetic active matter.</p>

<p>We find that there exist Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex
line of superconducting (SC) Weyl semimetals which break time reversal
symmetry. Since a Weyl semimetal can be regarded as Chern insulators
stacked along one (z) direction, so we decompose the vortex bound states
of SC Weyl semimetals into the vortex bound states of SC Chern
insulators labelled by kz. After calculating the topological phase
diagram of the SC Chern insulators both analytically and numerically, we
can explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of
them in SC Weyl semimetals. What's more, tuning the chemical potential
or the pairing strength can result in the MFBs along the whole kz axis.
Based on the above understanding, we propose a kz-dependent Z2
Chern-Simons invariant to characterize the MFBs. Finally, if we further
consider an attractive Hubbard interaction, the aforementioned SC Weyl
semimetal and MFBs can be realized under appropriate parameters.</p>

<p>Clifford circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) was
recently proposed to leverage the advantages of both Clifford circuits
and Matrix Product States (MPS). Clifford circuits can support large
entanglement and can be efficiently simulated classically according to
the Gottesman-Knill theorem. So in CAMPS, MPS needs only to handle the
so-called Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy which significantly
improves the simulation accuracy for a given bond dimension. In this
work, we generalize CAMPS to study the Fermion system by taking
advantage of the Jordan-Wigner transformation which can map the studied
Fermion system to a spin system. We benchmark the method on both the
spinless <span class="math inline">\(t-V\)</span> model and the spinful
Hubbard model. Our test results show significant improvement of the
accuracy of CAMPS over MPS, especially when the interactions are strong.
Fermionic CAMPS provides a useful tool for the accurate study of
many-body fermion systems in the future and has the potential to help
resolve long-standing issues.</p>

<p>Molecular complexes are held together via a variety of bonds, but
they all share the common feature that their individual entities are in
contact. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the concept of a ,
resulting from the far-field electromagnetic coupling of several
molecules via a shared mode of an optical microcavity. We discuss a
collective enhancement of the vacuum Rabi splitting and study super- and
sub-radiant states that arise from the cavity-mediated coupling both in
the resonant and dispersive regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate a
two-photon transition that emerges between the ground and excited states
of the new optical compound. Our experimental data are in excellent
agreement with the predictions of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and
open the door to the realization of hybrid light-matter materials.</p>

<p>Optically active defects often play a crucial role in governing the
light emission as well as the electronic properties of materials.
Moreover, defect-mediated states in the mid-gap region can trap
electrons, thus opening a path for the recombination of electrons and
holes in lower energy states that may require phonons in the process.
Considering this, we have probed electron-phonon interaction in halide
perovskite systems with the introduction of defects and investigated the
thermal effect on this interaction. Here, we report Raman spectroscopy
study of the thermal evolution of electron-phonon coupling, which is
tunable with the crystal growth conditions, in the halide perovskite
systems Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6. The signature of electron-phonon
coupling is observed as a Fano anomaly in the lowest frequency phonon
mode (51 cm-1) which evolves with temperature. In addition, we observe a
broad band in the photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the
defect-mediated systems, which is otherwise absent in defect-free halide
perovskite. The simultaneous observation of the Fano anomaly in the
Raman spectrum and the emergence of the PL band suggests the
defect-mediated mid-gap states and the consequent existence of
electron-phonon coupling in the double perovskite.</p>

<p>Almost a century on from the culmination of the first revolution in
quantum physics, we are poised for another. Even as we engage in the
creation of impactful quantum technologies, it is imperative for us to
face the challenges in understanding the phenomenology of various
emergent forms of quantum matter. This will involve building on decades
of progress in quantum condensed matter physics, and going beyond the
well-established Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm for quantum matter. We
outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need
to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the
development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue
to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress. These
efforts will enable the prediction of new quantum materials whose
properties facilitate the creation of next generation technologies.</p>

<p>Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state that has traits of
both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has gained significant
attention in the last few years and the underlying mechanisms driving
this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the phenomenological
models and group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary
explanation of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in
this work, we explored the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the
latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is
tunable, it provides a quantitative and more realistic mechanism to
explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principle
calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear
combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, belonging to the hexagonal NiAs
family (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.), we reveal that the second neighbor
interaction between the orbitals of the non-magnetic atoms is the most
deterministic in inducing altermagnetism. These second-neighbor bondings
modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite
spin sublattices. As a consequence, the antiferromagnetic sublattice
band degeneracy is lifted and it results in momentum dependent
altermagnetic spin split (ASS). We further reveal that the strong
altermagnetism is observed in these materials due to the participation
of multiple and selective orbitals, both from Ni and S, in the chemical
bonding. We proposed twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal
crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases
with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can
go beyond 1eV, which makes this compound ideal for carrying out
altermagnetic experiments and for exploring non-trivial quantum
transport through electron and hole doping. The present study opens up
new pathways to tailor tunable altermagnetism.</p>

<p>Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral
functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this
effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot
methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and
computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and
implementation for the non-perturbative calculations of spectral
functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying
this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency
qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties
compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to
reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The
developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant
electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.</p>

<p>A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of
the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion
collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole
plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the
enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity
determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio
is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by
temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed
or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we
find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework
will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason
is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per
particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene,
and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law
violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net
charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi
energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of
the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the
fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored
by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and
Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</p>

<p>Topological materials have gained significant attention in condensed
matter physics due to their unique electronic and transport properties.
Three-dimensional (3D) topological materials are characterized by robust
electronic states that are protected by symmetries and exhibit peculiar
spin textures. They offer a rich platform for for future information
technology including spintronics and topological quantum computing.
Here, we review the investigation by angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy (ARPES) of topological phases such as strong topological
insulators, topological crystalline insulators, magnetic topological
insulators, and 3D Dirac, Weyl, nodal, and chiral semimetals and address
the status of correlated topological insulators and topological
superconductors. A special emphasis is laid on examples from the
transition metal dichalcogenide family. Moreover, insights from
ultrafast pump-probe experiments are reviewed and a brief outlook is
provided.</p>

<p>We numerically investigate the phase behavior of thick shells of
cholesteric liquid crystals with tangential anchoring at the shell
boundary. For achiral liquid crystal, we demonstrate a
thickness-dependent transition from a configuration featuring four
disclination line connecting the inner and outer surfaces to a state
free of defect in the bulk, where each surface is topologically isolated
and features two boojums. Incorporating chirality stabilizes novel
defect arrangements, including a mixed state combining boojums and
disclination lines and blue phases at high chirality and we demonstrate
that shell thickness strongly modulates these transitions. Finally, we
exploit the metastability features of the observed phases to obtain an
elastically induced rearrangement of the shell surfaces during a
cholesteric hysteresis cycle, stabilizing an alternative configuration
that minimizes the free energy at low chirality. Our work paves the way
for exploring dynamic behaviors under external fields, mixed anchoring
conditions, or active flows.</p>

<p>The structure and stability of iron near melting at multi-megabar
pressures are of significant interest in high pressure physics and earth
and planetary sciences. While the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase is
generally recognized as unstable at lower temperatures, its stability
relative to the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at high temperatures
(approximately 0.5 eV) in the Earth's inner core (IC) remains a topic of
ongoing theoretical and experimental debate. Our ab initio calculations
show a significant drop in energy, the emergence of a plateau and a
local minimum in the potential energy surface, and stabilization of all
phonon modes at elevated electron temperatures (&gt;1-1.5 eV). These
effects increase the competition among the BCC, HCP, and the
face-centered cubic (FCC) phases and lead to the metastability of the
BCC structure. Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of BCC iron is
enhanced by its substantial lattice vibration entropy. This thermally
induced structural competitiveness and metastability under
non-equilibrium conditions provide a clear theoretical framework for
understanding iron phase relations and solidification processes, both
experimentally and in the IC.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain
wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic
computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls
within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3.
Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain
within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably
different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different
thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag
walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are
actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3
crystals and films.</p>

<p>"Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with
pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list,
achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be
challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior
of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing
temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We
identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce
stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically,
we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to
cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition
determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an
unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of
cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level,
observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically
rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally,
we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings,
enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</p>

<p>We introduce a solvable model of a measurement-induced phase
transition (MIPT) in a deterministic but chaotic dynamical system with a
positive Lyapunov exponent. In this setup, an observer only has a
probabilistic description of the system but mitigates chaos-induced
uncertainty through repeated measurements. Using a minimal
representation via a branching tree, we map this problem to the directed
polymer (DP) model on the Cayley tree, although in a regime dominated by
rare events. By studying the Shannon entropy of the probability
distribution estimated by the observer, we demonstrate a phase
transition distinguishing a chaotic phase with reduced Lyapunov exponent
from a strong-measurement phase where uncertainty remains bounded.
Remarkably, the location of the MIPT transition coincides with the
freezing transition of the DP, although the critical properties differ.
We provide an exact universal scaling function describing entropy growth
in the critical regime. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical
predictions, highlighting a simple yet powerful framework to explore
measurement-induced transitions in classical chaotic systems.</p>

<p>The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical
model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate
high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable
quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet
suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J
model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly
engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and
inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with
next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly
explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far
beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we
predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum
entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space
fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted
thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic
quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall
also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom
systems.</p>

<p>Superconductivity and nontrivial topology are highly sought-after
phenomena in quantum materials. While many topological crystalline
materials have been found to exhibit superconductivity, their presence
in quasicrystals - materials with a unique aperiodic yet ordered
structure - has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the
discovery of superconductivity in a monoclinic approximant to the
decagonal quasicrystal Al<span
class="math inline">\(_{13}\)</span>Os<span
class="math inline">\(_{4}\)</span>, that exhibits a high
superconducting transition temperature and a nontrivial electronic
structure. The resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>SR measurements confirm
superconductivity with a critical temperature of <span
class="math inline">\(\sim5.47\)</span> K. Detailed electronic structure
and symmetry analysis reveal nontrivial state with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}_{2}=1\)</span> and spin-polarized
conducting surface states. Importantly, we identify three-dimensional
saddle point van Hove singularities with substantial flat energy
dispersion at the Fermi level, which can enhance superconductivity. Our
results highlight a rich interplay between superconductivity and
nontrivial electronic states in Al<span

<p>Chromium is a common transition-metal impurity that is easily
incorporated during crystal growth. It is perhaps best known for giving
rise to the 694.3 nm (1.786 eV) emission in Cr-doped Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>, exploited in ruby lasers. Chromium
has also been found in monoclinic gallium oxide, a wide-bandgap
semiconductor being pursued for power electronics. In this work, we
thoroughly characterize the behavior of Cr in Ga<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> through theoretical and experimental
techniques. <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-Ga<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> samples are grown with the floating
zone method and show evidence of a sharp photoluminescence signal,
reminiscent of ruby. We calculate the energetics of formation of Cr from
first principles, demonstrating that Cr preferentially incorporates as a
neutral impurity on the octahedral site. Cr possesses a quartet
ground-state spin and has an internal transition with a zero-phonon line
near 1.8 eV. By comparing the calculated and experimentally measured
luminescence lineshape function, we elucidate the role of coupling to
phonons and uncover features beyond the Franck-Condon approximation. The
combination of strong emission with a small Huang-Rhys factor of 0.05
and a technologically relevant host material render Cr in Ga<span

<p>Thermoelectric materials provide a sustainable way to convert waste
heat into electricity. However, data-driven discovery and optimization
of these materials are challenging because of a lack of a reliable
database. Here we developed a comprehensive database of 7,123
thermoelectric compounds, containing key information such as chemical
composition, structural detail, seebeck coefficient, electrical and
thermal conductivity, power factor, and figure of merit (ZT). We used
the GPTArticleExtractor workflow, powered by large language models
(LLM), to extract and curate data automatically from the scientific
literature published in Elsevier journals. This process enabled the
creation of a structured database that addresses the challenges of
manual data collection. The open access database could stimulate
data-driven research and advance thermoelectric material analysis and
discovery.</p>

<p>Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer
topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries,
leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states
(ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called
statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this
work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band
insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized
magneto-electric polarization <span
class="math inline">\(P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)\)</span>. A <span
class="math inline">\(C_{4}T\)</span> symmetry reverses the sign of
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> angle, hence seems to
protect a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span>
classification of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\!=\!0,\pi\)</span>.
However, we prove that, if <span class="math inline">\((C_{4}T)^4 \!=\!
1\)</span>, the topological state with <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\!=\!\pi\)</span> cannot be realized in band
insulators where <span class="math inline">\(C_{4}T\)</span> is exact.
Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we
find that an STI with <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\!=\!\pi\)</span> can arise in Anderson
insulators with disorders respecting <span
class="math inline">\(C_{4}T\)</span> on average. To illustrate this
state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using
the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible
system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface
states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk.
As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both
clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the
intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI
is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions
cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean
system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and
its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other
crystalline symmetries.</p>

<p>Interatomic potentials play a vital role in revealing microscopic
details and structure-property relations, which are fundamental for
multiscale simulations and to assist high-throughput experiments. For
metallic glasses, developing these potentials is challenging due to the
complexity of their unique disordered structure. As a result,
chemistry-specific interaction potentials for this important class of
materials are often missing. Here, we solve this gap by implementing an
efficient methodology for designing machine learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) for metallic glasses, and we benchmark it with the
widely studied CuZrAl system. By combining a Lennard-Jones surrogate
model with swap-Monte Carlo sampling and Density Functional Theory (DFT)
corrections, we capture diverse amorphous structures from 14 decades of
supercooling. These distinct structures provide robust and efficient
training of the model and applicability to the wider spectrum of
energies. This approach reduces the need for extensive DFT and ab initio
optimization datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. Our MLIP shows
results comparable to the classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) available
for CuZrAl, in predicting structural, energetic, and mechanical
properties. This work paves the way for the development of new MLIPs for
complex metallic glasses, including emerging multicomponent and high
entropy metallic glasses.</p>

<p>The development of solid-state batteries is hindered by the
degradation of the solid-solid interface during cycling which can cause
void formation and contact loss. Here, we systematically investigate the
effect of unrecoverable and real interfacial contact area at the
electrode/Li<span class="math inline">\(_6\)</span>PS<span
class="math inline">\(_5\)</span>Cl interface on the impedance spectrum.
By varying applied stack pressures and controlling contact geometries,
we identify their distinct signatures in the impedance spectrum and
quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and effective
ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. Experimental results
demonstrate that higher pressures and improved contact areas
significantly reduce interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance
scales with pressure according to power law with exponent of -0.5,
providing insights into the variation of real contact area. Further,
distributed contacts lead to lower impedance compared to concentrated
contacts due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential
distribution. Our simulations predict interfacial resistances of the
contact geometries in agreement with experiments. Our work emphasizes
the distinct roles of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses in
controlling the impedance of solid-state batteries.</p>

<p>The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful tool in
computational fluid dynamics and material science. However, standard LBM
formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method,
particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new
velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In
this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a
bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough
independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the
moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third

<p>Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream
in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a
semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when
optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens
e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase
transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the
excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the
intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and
dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a
view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a
semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative.
After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can
appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting
with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping
of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical
value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in
domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist
even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</p>

<p>Active colloidal particles typically exhibit a pronounced affinity
for accumulating and being captured at boundaries. Here, we engineer
long-range repulsive interactions between colloids that self-propel
under an electric field and patterned obstacles. As a result of these
interactions, particles turn away from obstacles and avoid accumulation.
We show that by tuning the applied field frequency, we precisely and
rapidly control the effective size of the obstacles and therefore
modulate the particle approach distance. This feature allows us to
achieve gating and tunable confinement of our active particles whereby
they can access regions between obstacles depending on the applied
field. Our work provides a versatile means to directly control
confinement and organization, paving the way towards applications such
as sorting particles based on motility or localizing active particles on
demand.</p>

<p>The effective stress parameter, <span

effective stress in unsaturated soils. Experimental measurements have
captured different relationships between <span

justify the particular shapes of the <span

class="math inline">\(S_r\)</span> curves. Theoretical solutions express
<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> as a function of <span

<span class="math inline">\(a_{wn}\)</span>; however, <span

further investigation of <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>
variation. We seek an alternative approach for studying <span
class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> by simulating the pore-scale
distribution of the two fluid phases in unsaturated soils using the
multiphase lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We develop an algorithm for
measuring <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> based on the suction
and surface tension forces applied to each grain. Using this algorithm,
we simulate the <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(S_r\)</span> curve over a full hydraulic cycle for
a synthetic 3D granular soil column with immobile grains. We find that
<span class="math inline">\(\chi=1\)</span> at <span

The maximum divergence of <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> from
<span class="math inline">\(S_r\)</span> happens at the transition

<p>Cells and microorganisms employ dynamic shape changes to enable
steering and avoidance for efficient spatial exploration and collective
organization. In contrast, active colloids, their synthetic
counterparts, currently lack similar abilities and strategies. Through
physical interactions alone, here we create active colloidal molecules
that spontaneously reconfigure their structure, unlike traditional
active particles. We find that self-reconfiguration decouples
reorientational dynamics from rotational diffusivity and bestows our
active molecules additional reorientation capabilities. During
encounters with neighbors, rapid conformational changes lead to
self-steering and avoidance. At higher area fractions,
reconfiguration-induced avoidance fully inhibits characteristic dynamic
clustering, motility-induced phase separation and flocking; instead, the
system retains a homogeneous structure comprising well-separated active
units. Self-reconfiguring systems therefore present an exciting path
towards autonomous motion beyond that of classical synthetic active
matter.</p>

<p>Diagrammatic expansions are a paradigmatic and powerful tool of
quantum many-body theory. Their evaluation to high order, e.g., by the
Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, can provide unbiased results in
strongly correlated and challenging regimes. However, calculating a
factorial number of terms to acceptable precision remains very costly
even for state-of-the-art methods. We achieve a dramatic acceleration of
evaluating Feynman's diagrammatic series by use of specialised hardware
architecture within the recently introduced combinatorial summation
(CoS) framework. We present how exploiting the massive parallelism and
concurrency available from GPUs leads to orders of magnitude improvement
in computation time even on consumer-grade hardware. This provides a
platform for making probes of novel phenomena of strong correlations
much more accessible.</p>

<p>Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical
framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with
microscopic material properties derived from statistical this http URL
empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid
microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior
with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a
time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's
statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework
is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium
time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the
conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the
transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave
propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across
broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models
that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our
approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of
intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies
universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By
integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with
continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust
foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields.
Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient
thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and
ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength
ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.</p>

the critical temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{\rm c}\)</span>,
serves as a crucial experimental validation of the

superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional
coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole
resonance on YBa<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>Cu<span
class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_8\)</span>, pointing to a distinctive pairing

relaxation rate <span class="math inline">\(1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}\)</span>,
which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate
<span class="math inline">\(1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}\)</span>, which probes
charge fluctuations. By utilizing <span
class="math inline">\(^{63}\)</span>Cu and <span

coherence peak in <span class="math inline">\(1/T_{1 }^{\rm
quad}\)</span> but not in <span class="math inline">\(1/T_{1}^{\rm

demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a
coherence peak in <span class="math inline">\(1/T_{1}\)</span> when the
relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a
coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric
field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors
between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of
<span class="math inline">\(1/T_{1}\)</span> for the chains of YBa<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>Cu<span
class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>O<span

could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of
the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.</p>

<p>According to the theory of group representations, the types of band
degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential
degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically
resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we
propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but
is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable,
dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is
guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror
symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and
magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic
layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror
symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122
candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate
spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and
time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital
coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs
have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice
models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific
electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4<span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>+2 in spinless systems (and 2<span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>+1 in spinful systems), the presence of
the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the
systems. Using calculations, we further identify possible material
candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful
HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of
momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type
of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the
related physics of HENLs.</p>

<p>Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current
with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer
promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular
magnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices. In this study, we
investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3d ferromagnetic metals
including spin-orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni and
their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from
anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L10-MnAl as an example.
By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature
and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni
and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities
with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are at
the order of 1000 ( , )^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin
Hall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity.
For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach
up to 10000 ( , )^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room
temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we
demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization
without an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals as
spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding
on spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their
potential applications in related spintronic devices.</p>

<p>The study of topological states has become an important topic in both
solid-state systems and artificial structures such as photonic crystals
and phononic crystals. Among them, Majorana zero modes, which exhibit
nontrivial braiding process, have attracted extensive research interest.
The analog of Majorana zero modes in classical waves, or the
Majorana-like zero modes (MLZMs), have also got a lot of attention
recently. However, the vast majority of previous works concerned with
MLZMs that were bounded to vortexes inside the bulk. Here in this work,
we unveil the braiding rule of MLZMs that are tunable around the
boundary of a vortex-texture Kekule modulated graphene. We show that the
existence of these zero-dimensional boundary MLZMs is protected by the
Zak phase of 1D boundary states. As such, we are able to construct
multiple MLZMs and analyze the corresponding braiding process. In
addition, we also provide an implementation scheme of the boundary MLZMs
in acoustic crystals. The tunability of the boundary MLZMs proposed
herein offer new freedom for topological states braiding in both
solid-state systems and artificial structures.</p>

<p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising
candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and
capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However,
existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism
independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which
leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative
vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>/MnPSe<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>/CrBr<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> vertical heterostructure, enabling
genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration
induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization
reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the
spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure.
By integrating asymmetric PtTe<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>/alkali-metal
(Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>
electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a
maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding <span
class="math inline">\(8.1\times10^5\)</span>% and tunneling
electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499%, while the spin-filtering
channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of
the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad
bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances
these metrics, increasing TMR to <span class="math inline">\(3.6\times
10^7\)</span>% and TER to 9990%. Notably, a pronounced negative
differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an
unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of <span
class="math inline">\(9.55\times10^9\)</span>%, the highest value
reported to date. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the
potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key
feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a
solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing
high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

<p>Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), the variation in resistance in a
heavy metal (HM) with the magnetization orientation of an adjacent
ferromagnet (FM), has been extensively studied as a powerful tool for
probing surface magnetic moments in a variety of magnetic materials.
However, the conventional SMR theory assumes rigid magnetization of a
fixed magnitude, an assumption that breaks down close to the FM's Curie
temperature (T_c), where the magnetic susceptibility diverges. Here, we
report an unconventional SMR effect arising from the magnetic-field
modulation of spin fluctuations in the FM, while its magnetization
remaining collinear to the spin Hall accumulation in the HM. In contrast
to the conventional SMR, which scales with the magnetization and
vanishes near <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span>, such
``longitudinal" SMR (LSMR), though suppressed at low temperatures,
becomes critically enhanced at (T_c), reaching a magnitude comparable to
conventional SMR amplitudes. Our findings suggest a promising method for
electrically detecting enhanced spin fluctuations in magnetic
systems.</p>

<p>The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has
provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical
mechanism may differ in chiral enantiomers, however, the origin of the
effect itself is yet an open question. In this article, it is
theoretically shown that two aspects have to be fulfilled for the chiral
induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a
necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular structures
that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is
indispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing
spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in
terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be
coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity
effect.</p>

<p>The "Tete de moine" Swiss cheese is generally served by scraping the
surface of a cylindrical loaf with a sharp tool. This produces thin
sheets of cheese that are strongly wrinkled at the edge, resembling
frilly flowers and enhancing the tasting experience. In this work we
unveil the physical mechanisms at play in this scraping-induced
morphogenesis. We measure the deformation of the cheese during scraping
and show that plastic deformation occurs everywhere, but find a larger
plastic contraction in the inner part of the flower, causing its
buckling into shape. We show that it surprisingly derives from the lower
friction coefficient evidenced on the cheese close to its crust. Our
analysis provides the tools for a better control of chip morphogenesis
through plasticity in the shaping of other delicacies, but also in metal
cutting.</p>

<p>The room temperature growth, characterization, and electrical
transport properties of magnetron sputtered superconducting Ti40V60
alloy thin films are presented. The films exhibit low surface roughness
and tunable transport properties. As the sputtering current increases,
the superconducting transition move towards higher temperatures.
Rietveld refinement of two dimensional XRD (2D XRD) pattern reveals the
presence of stress in the films, which shifts from tensile to
compressive as the sputtering current increases. Additionally, the
crystallite size of the films increases with higher sputtering currents.
The films exhibit a strong preferential orientation, contributing to
their texturing. The crystallite size and texturing are found to be
correlated with the superconducting transition temperature (TC) of the
films. As the crystallite size and texturing increase, the TC of the
films also rises.</p>

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as
a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic and spintronic
devices. Mechanical exfoliation using adhesive tape remains the dominant
method for preparing 2D materials of highest quality, including
transition metal dichalcogenides, but always results in small-sized
flakes. This limitation poses a significant challenge for investigations
and applications where large scale flakes are needed. To overcome these
constraints, we explored the preparation of 2D WS2 and WSe2 using a
recently developed kinetic in situ single-layer synthesis method (KISS).
In particular, we focused on the influence of different substrates, Au
and Ag, and chalcogen atoms, S and Se, on the yield and quality of the
2D films. The crystallinity and spatial morphology of the 2D films were
characterized using optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy,
providing a comprehensive assessment of exfoliation quality. Low-energy
electron diffraction verified that there is no preferential orientation
between the 2D film and the substrate, while optical microscopy revealed
that WSe2 consistently outperformed WS2 in producing large monolayers,
regardless of the substrate used. Finally, X-ray diffraction and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that no covalent bonds are formed
between the 2D material and the underlying substrate. These results
identify KISS method as a non-destructive approach for a more scalable
approach of high-quality 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

<p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the nonreciprocity
of superconducting critical currents for the metal-superconductor
transition. Generally, the SDE has a positive and a negative critical
current <span class="math inline">\(j_{c\pm}\)</span> corresponding to
two opposite directions whose amplitudes are unequal. It is demonstrated
that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can become
both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In
this work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an
extreme nonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple
valley-polarized model, we demonstrate that depairing currents required
to dissolve Cooper pairs can be remodulated under the interplay between
the valley polarization and the applied current. Near the disappearance
of the superconductivity, the remodulation is shown to induce the
extreme nonreciprocity and also the current-induced re-entrant
superconductivity where the system has two different critical current
intervals. Our study may provide new horizons for understanding the
coexistence of superconductivity and spontaneous ferromagnetism and pave
a new way to designing the SDE with 100% efficiency.</p>

<p>The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current
flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly
advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to
describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the
intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on
the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in
the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the
gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the
anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the
presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances
continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside
the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current.
This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena
in open systems.</p>

<p>A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to
thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state
eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A
paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity
breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong
disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization.
It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be
delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this
consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic
dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions
between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we
promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting
quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a
steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit
dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an
experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold
atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible
over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for
experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent
dynamics.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas are
Goldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of the
system is invariant under the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span>
transformation <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}%
\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\)</span>, whereas the order parameter <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\)</span> is not. However, the
strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundary
conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the is
not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system of
spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standard
Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, and
the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our results
show that the answer to the question in the title is no. Thus, phonons
in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in a
classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collective
vibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In the
case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical:
the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate or
non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and
different from it.</p>

<p>Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament
formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive
switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This
study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of
different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs,
employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium
Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms,
Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both
in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS layer and along the surface
of the MoS layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and
lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present
in MoS are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of
metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine
MoS and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key
elements that affect the switching performance of memristors.
Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the
effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance,
providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</p>

<p>The information engine extracts work from a single heat bath using
mutual information obtained during the operation cycle. This study
investigates the influence of the potential shaping in a Brownian
information engine (BIE) in harnessing the information from thermal
fluctuations. We have designed a BIE by considering an overdamped
Brownian particle inside a confined potential and introducing an
appropriate symmetric feedback cycle. We find that the upper bound of
the extractable work for a BIE with a monostable centrosymmetric
confining potential, with a stable state at the potential centre,
depends on the bath temperature and the convexity of the confinement. A
concave confinement is more efficient for an information-energy
exchange. For a bistable confinement with an unstable centre and two
symmetric stable basins, one can find an engine-to-refrigeration
transition beyond a certain barrier height related to the energy
difference between the energy barrier and the stable basins. Finally, we
use the concavity-induced gain in information harnessing to device a BIE
in the presence of a multistable potential that can harvest even more
energy than monostable confinement.</p>

<p>Anisotropic materials with low symmetries hold significant promise
for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. 2M-WS2, a candidate
for topological superconductivity, has garnered considerable interest.
However, a comprehensive understanding of how its anisotropic features
contribute to unconventional superconductivity, along with a simple,
reliable method to identify its crystal orientation, remains elusive.
Here, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate
angle- and polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman modes of 2M-WS2.
Through first-principles calculations, we predict and analyze phonon
dispersion and lattice vibrations of all Raman modes in 2M-WS2. We
establish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectra
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, we
demonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determine
the crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2
layers. Our findings provide insights into the electron-phonon coupling
and anisotropic properties of 2M-WS2, paving the way for the use of
anisotropic materials in advanced electronic and quantum devices.</p>

<p>Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most
informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient
characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural
networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty
quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully
Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability
distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods,
offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost.
Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where
only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain
deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active
learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower
computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions
with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate
that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to
accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these
approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science
tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with
limited, complex datasets.</p>

<p>In an earlier preprint (V. V. Ginzburg, O. V. Gendelman, R. Casalini,
and A. Zaccone, arXiv:2409.17291), we demonstrated that the dynamic
(relaxation time) and volume equations of state for many amorphous
polymers are near-universal -- each material is characterized by two
governing parameters -- the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, and the
elementary relaxation time, /tau_{el}. The dynamic fragility, m, is
uniquely related to /tau_{el}. The earlier analysis was based on the
data for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N &gt; 200, and
molecular weight, Mw &gt; 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate the
dependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on the
molecular weight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data for
homologous series of four polymers: polystyrene (PS),
poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and
polybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the relaxation time curves for
various oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto the same master
curve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature and the
dynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreement
with the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted based
on the SL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistent
with the Boyer rules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above and
below T_{g}, as well as the thermodynamical scaling for the pressure
dependence of the relaxation time.</p>

<p>We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in
multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We
introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with
the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then
demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in
these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response
distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We
find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity
universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs
from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting
bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures
in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order
nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can
result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic
topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we
generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler
superconductors.</p>

<p>We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted
Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned
structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of
voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity
and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant
changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The
piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011]
direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt
heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE)
shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain.
Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG
film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90° switching of the
magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric
coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is
competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on
ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT.
Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide
dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient
non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</p>

<p>We study Hopfield networks with non-reciprocal coupling inducing
switches between memory patterns. Dynamical phase transitions occur
between phases of no memory retrieval, retrieval of multiple
point-attractors, and limit-cycle attractors. The limit cycle phase is
bounded by two critical regions: a Hopf bifurcation line and a fold
bifurcation line, each with unique dynamical critical exponents and
sensitivity to perturbations. A Master Equation approach numerically
verifies the critical behavior predicted analytically. We discuss how
these networks could model biological processes near a critical
threshold of cyclic instability evolving through multi-step
transitions.</p>

<p>Magnetic kagome metals have garnered considerable attention as an

present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb<span

parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) Å and c = 9.536(8) Å. Magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic

<p>Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a
fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and
non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a
complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are
recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present
an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose
system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events.
This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in
correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network,
providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies
existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and
reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of
multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical
significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of
response properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practical
advantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far from
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether
similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using
the fluctuation of the topological charge inside a loop to characterize
the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo
simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the
perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while to the area of the loop
at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low
temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.</p>

<p>Kibble-Zurek scaling is the scaling of the density of the topological
defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with respect to the rate
at which a system is cooled across a continuous phase transition.
Recently, the density of the topological defects formed via the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism was computed for a system cooled through a
first-order phase transition instead of the usual continuous
transitions. Here we address the problem of whether such defects
generated across a first-order phase transition exhibit Kibble-Zurek
scaling similar to the case in continuous phase transitions. We show
that any possible Kibble-Zurek scaling for the topological defects can
only be a very rough approximation due to an intrinsic field for the
scaling. However, complete universal scaling for other properties does
exist.</p>

<p>Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is
critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and
photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning
(ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D
materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the
Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D
Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between
cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties,
significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with
pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with
Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials
with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery
process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile
and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its
applicability in materials discovery.</p>

<p>We study the two-dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet and
antiferromagnet with a magnetic field by using tensor network method.
Focusing on the role of guage fixing, we present the partition function
in terms of a tensor network. The tensor has a different symmetry
property for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The tensor network of
the partition function is interpreted as a multiple product of the
one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. We perform infinite density matrix
renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We
present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy
for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to
determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and
magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the
one-dimensional quantum state. The entanglement entropy precisely
indicates the critical line forming the parabolic shape for the
antiferromagnetic case, but shows the critical point for the
ferromagnetic case.</p>

<p>Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to
be an NP-hard problem. There is a widespread belief that this statement
implies an exponential scaling, <span class="math inline">\(\sim

quantum), with the number of spins, <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Yet, what is a factor <span

limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive
experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with <span

(in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses
with the efficiency, characterized by <span

further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms
and device noise reduction, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
can be increased even further. We provide a theoretical argumentation
for this observation based on statistical analysis of low energy
states.</p>

<p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state
single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from
infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed
to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN.
Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters
is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we
studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral
boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with
zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often
observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen
antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed
as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution
defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which
significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide
useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

<p>While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and
more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic
resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random
moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor
between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting
position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the
main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically,
we consider both symmetric <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-stable Lévy processes (Lévy
flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We
derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary
measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly,
while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs
for the Brownian motion, but not for Lévy flights. We also analyze the
behavior of the process around the resetting position and find
significant differences between PSR and total resetting.</p>

<p>Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied
by distinctive nonequilibrium features such as negative apparent heat
dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we
study the frequency decompositions of the heat dissipation in linear
time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically solve Langevin equations
with a single linear time-delayed feedback force and calculate the
spectrum of the heat dissipation in the frequency domain using the
Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the
violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). We find a
characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, which
asymptotically oscillates sinusoidally with a decaying envelope
proportional to the strength of the time-delayed force and the inverse
of the frequency. We confirm the generality of the results by extending
our analysis to systems with multiple delay times and continuously
distributed delay times. Since the violation of FDR is experimentally
accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting
and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed
systems.</p>

<p>This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in
unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave pairing and interlayer <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-wave pairing. We reveal that in the
context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an
intrinsic connection between the <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave pairing symmetry and the
appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the
<span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> rotational symmetry of both the
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave gap amplitude and the square
lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the
in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems
with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the
absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter.
By utilizing the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>-matrix approach,
we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states.
Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly
discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a
powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results
of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing
symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors,
paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of
these emerging materials.</p>

<p>While either spin or point-group adaptation is straightforward when
considered independently, the standard technique for factoring isotropic
spin Hamiltonians by the total spin S and the irreducible representation
of the point-group is limited by the complexity of transformations
between different coupling-schemes that are related by
site-permutations. To overcome these challenges, we apply
projection-operators directly to uncoupled basis-states, enabling the
simultaneous treatment of spin and point-group symmetry without the need
for recoupling-transformations. This provides a simple and efficient
approach for the exact diagonalization of isotropic spin-models that we
illustrate with applications to Heisenberg spin-rings and polyhedra,
including systems that are computationally inaccessible with
conventional coupling-techniques.</p>

<p>Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays
a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex
interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it
challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we
investigate the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> spin interaction in well-defined
metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and
four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA
molecule is turned into a spin-<span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>
radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling
with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based
on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates
the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the
coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic
coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin
orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of
spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides
microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.</p>

<p>Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in
integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the
challenges associated with designing magnonic waveguides and propose a
novel type with promising properties. Specifically, we study a magnonic
waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co<span
class="math inline">\(_{20}\)</span>Fe<span
class="math inline">\(_{60}\)</span>B<span
class="math inline">\(_{20}\)</span>) through surface anisotropy applied
in stripe regions, creating Bragg mirror structures. The proposed
waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high
velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while avoiding static
demagnetizing effects. Using finite element simulations, we calculate
the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial
profiles. Additionally, we evaluate the group velocity and localization
characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the
waveguide's performance.</p>

<p>Grain boundaries affect properties of polycrystalline materials. The
influence of a boundary is largely determined by its energy. Grain
boundary energy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundary
parameters representing grain misorientation and boundary plane
inclination. In grain boundary simulation and modeling, many studies
neglect structural multiplicity of boundaries, i.e., existence of
metastable states, and focus on minimum energy. The minimum energy
function restricted to constant misorientation should satisfy Herring's
condition for interface stability. This requirement has been ignored in
recent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example violations of
the stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and natural
procedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying the
condition is described. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundary
plane inclinations arise because of the imposition of the stability
condition, and their locations and shapes result from properties of
input data. An example of applying the procedure to simulated data is
presented.</p>

<p>Domain structures play a crucial role in the electric, mechanical and
other properties of ferroelectric materials. In this study, we uncover
the physical origins of the enigmatic zigzag domain structure in the
prototypical multiferroic material BiFeO<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. Using phase-field simulations within
the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we demonstrate that
spatially-homogeneous defect charges result in domain structures that
closely resemble those observed experimentally. The acquired
understanding of the underlying physics of pyramidal-domain formation
may enable the engineering of new materials with self-assembled domain
structures exhibiting defined domain periodicity at the nanometre scale,
opening avenues for advanced applications.</p>

<p>Understanding the formation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials
is a problem of fundamental and technological interest. GdRu2Si2 is one
such candidate material which has been shown to host a variety of
multi-Q magnetic structures, including in zero-field. Here, inelastic
neutron scattering is used to measure the spin excitations in the
field-polarized phase of GdRu2Si2. Linear spin wave theory and a method
of interaction invariant path analysis are used to derive a Hamiltonian
accounting for the observed spectra, and comparisons to calculations are
made. No evidence for anisotropic or higher order-exchange terms beyond
bilinear Heisenberg exchange is found. This is discussed in the context
of the multi-Q states existing at lower fields, for which these types of
terms have previously been conceived to be significant in the formation
of multi-Q ground states.</p>

<p>Many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) offers a significant
speed-up in the simulation of various systems, including soft matter, in
comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on
Lennard-Jones nteractions, which is crucial for describing phenomena
characterized by large time and length scales. Moreover, it has recently
been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is
applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex
systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical
times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by
using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant
properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG
simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into
structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence
regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided.
In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the
general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides
significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated
times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.</p>

<p>Diatoms have been described as nanometer-born lithographers because
of their ability to create sophisticated three-dimensional amorphous
silica exoskeletons. The hierarchical architecture of these structures
provides diatoms with mechanical protection and the ability to filter,
float, and manipulate light. Therefore, they emerge as an extraordinary
model of multifunctional materials from which to draw inspiration. In
this paper, we use numerical simulations, analytical models, and
experimental tests to unveil the structural and fluid dynamic efficiency
of the Coscinodiscus species diatom. Then we propose a novel 3D
printable multifunctional biomimetic material for applications such as
porous filters, heat exchangers, drug delivery systems, lightweight
structures, and robotics. Our results demonstrate the role of Nature as
a material designer for efficient and tunable systems and highlight the
potential of diatoms for engineering materials innovation. Additionally,
the results reported in this paper lay the foundation to extend the
structure-property characterization of diatoms.</p>

<p>The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of
self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed
<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> along a direction that changes
slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient <span
class="math inline">\(\Dr\)</span>. Persistent motion plus random
reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion
coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by <span
class="math inline">\(D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)\)</span>. Here we study the density
effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic
theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as
producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate
timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of
the tagged particle has not yet changed, an effective stochastic
dynamics emerges, characterized by an effective reduced streaming
velocity <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{eff}\)</span> and
anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on
density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical
approach is proposed in which the particles follow stochastic dynamics
with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on
time scales larger than <span class="math inline">\(\Dr^{-1}\)</span>,
the tagged particle shows an effective diffusive motion with a
coefficient <span
class="math inline">\(D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)\)</span>. The dependence
of <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{eff}\)</span> on density
indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to are fractions smaller
than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.</p>

<p>The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the
continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature
of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme
confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between
water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining
materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic
flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to
condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of
many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid
can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds
with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the
range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's
electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at
resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling
is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic
networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further
suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for
manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and
characteristics of individual molecules.</p>

<p>We consider a coupled system of a qubit and a magnon mode in which
the qubit is weakly driven. We demonstrate that the spectral
steady-state responses of both the qubit and the magnon show, in
addition to two sidebands split by the coupling, also a peak at the
driving frequency with virtually zero linewidth. This phenomenon, which
persists at both strong and weak coupling, is an analog of the Heitler
effect in atomic physics, and shows the path towards building of
coherent magnon sources.</p>

<p>The structural properties of packed soft-core particles provide a
platform to understand the cross-pollinated physical concepts in
solid-state- and soft-matter physics. Confined on spherical surface, the
traditional differential geometry also dictates the overall defect
properties in otherwise regular crystal lattices. Using molecular
dynamics simulation of the Hertzian model as a tool, we report here the
emergence of new types of disclination patterns: domain and
counter-domain defects, when hexagonal and square patterns coexist. A
new angle is presented to understand the incompatibility between tiling
lattice shapes and the available spherical areal shapes, which is common
in nature -- from molecular systems in biology to backbone construction
in architectures.</p>

<p>We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional
and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For
that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the
QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying
Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of
states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we
observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if
the junction has <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave symmetry,
meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the
thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically
and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in
the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient,
the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</p>

<p>Launching and focusing phonon-polaritons present novel opportunities
for low-loss guiding of subdiffractionally confined light at the
nanoscale. Despite significant efforts to improve control in polaritonic
media, focused and spatially confined phonon-polariton waves have only
been achieved in the in-plane anisotropic crystals (such as MoO<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>) and remain elusive in the in-plane
isotropic crystals (such as hexagonal boron nitride). In this study, we
present a previously unexplored approach to launching phonon-polaritons
by employing hBN subwavelength resonators coupled to gold nanoantennas.
The integration of gold nanoantennas enables efficient coupling to the
far-field component of mid-infrared light, while the geometry of the
resonators defines the wavefront curvature, spatial confinement, and
focusing of the launched polaritons. Using standard lithographic
protocols, we achieve strong field enhancement and resonant mode
localization, generating phonon-polaritons with precise spatial
definition. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy
reveals the real-space optical contrast of these modes. This innovative
and practical approach introduces a new paradigm for fabricating
nanoresonators that actively launch and focus phonon-polaritons, opening
avenues for advanced nanophotonic devices.</p>

<p>The collective chasing dynamics of non-reciprocally coupled densities
leads to stable travelling waves which can be mapped to a model for
emergent flocking. In this work, we couple the non-reciprocal
Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH) to a fluid to minimally describe scalar
active mixtures in a suspension, with the aim to explore the stability
of the waves, i.e. the emergent flock in the presence of self-generated
fluid flows. We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to
perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling
instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical
simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves
against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.</p>

<p>We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a
topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A
single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless
mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of
skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the
formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We
show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help
of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice
geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet
phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use
a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands
of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which
there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is
essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to
describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.</p>

<p>We investigate the dynamics of close-contact melting (CCM) on
gas-trapped hydrophobic surfaces, with specific focus on the effects of
geometrical confinement and the liquid-air meniscus below the liquid
film. By employing dual-series and perturbation methods, we obtain
numerical solutions for the effective slip lengths associated with
velocity <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and temperature
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_t\)</span> fields, across various
values of aspect ratio <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>
(defined as the ratio of the film thickness <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> to the structure's periodic length
<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>) and gas-liquid fraction <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>. Asymptotic solutions of <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_t\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\ll 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda \gg 1\)</span> are derived and summarized
for different surface structures, interface shapes and <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, which reveal a different trend
for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda \ll 1\)</span> and the presence of a
meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate
that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer.
However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the
effects of confinement and meniscus when <span
class="math inline">\(\Lambda \lessapprox 0.1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi &lt; 1 - 0.5^{2/3} \approx 0.37\)</span>. For
gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span

is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram
based on the parameter matrix <span class="math inline">\((\log_{10} l,

asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the
unmelted solid height.</p>

<p>We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity,
magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic circular and
linear dichroism (XMCD, XMLD), as well as the electrical resistivity of
EuMn<span class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span>P<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span> single crystals. Antiferromagnetic
order of Eu was observed in several quantities at <span
class="math inline">\(T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\,=\,18\,\rm K\)</span>. The
temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show, when
approaching the Eu-ordered state, a divergence towards <span
class="math inline">\(T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\)</span>, indicating the
growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal
magnetic fields. An additional temperature scale of <span
class="math inline">\(\approx 47\,\rm K\)</span> has considerable impact
on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence
of weak Mn-based ordering. The observed ESR line is interpreted as an
Eu<span class="math inline">\(^{2+}\)</span> resonance, which probes the
weak magnetic background of the Mn subsystem. Such picture is suggested
by the lineshape which keeps to be Lorentzian across the <span
class="math inline">\(47\,\rm K\)</span> scale and by the ESR intensity
which can be described by the same Curie-Weiss temperature above and
below <span class="math inline">\(47\,\rm K\)</span>. In the same
temperature range anomalies were observed at <span
class="math inline">\(48.5\,\rm K\)</span> and <span

well as a pronounced broadening of the NMR signal of the EuMn<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span>P<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span> samples. In XMCD and XMLD
measurements, this weak magnetic order could not be detected in the same

a potential <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>-component or
frustration.</p>

<p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in
which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance
<span class="math inline">\(h/e^2\)</span> in the absence of magnetic
field, where <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the Planck
constant and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the electron
charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and
thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more
versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional
QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its
bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the
distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the
three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial
direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction,
and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi
energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through
a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi
energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction,
its Hall resistance can quantize to <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(h/e^2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\pm
h/e^2\)</span> when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral
point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall
effect family but also holds significant potentials in device
applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

<p>Zero-field magnetic noise, characterised by the magnetic
autocorrelation function <span class="math inline">\(S_s(t)\)</span>,
has been observed, perhaps surprisingly, to depend on sample shape <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The reasons for this are identified
and general expressions are derived that relate the autocorrelation
functions for systems of different shape to an underlying `intrinsic'
form. Assuming the flcutuatiopn-dissipation theorem, it is shown that,
for any noise that relaxes monotonically, the effect of sample shape is
to reduce both the noise amplitude and mean relaxation time by a factor
of <span class="math inline">\(1+N\chi_i\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the demagnetizing factor and <span
class="math inline">\(\chi_i\)</span> the intrinsic susceptibility. In
frequency space, where <span class="math inline">\(S_s(t)\)</span>
Fourier transforms into the power spectrum <span
class="math inline">\(S_s(\omega)\)</span>, the above two factors
combine to suppress the zero frequency amplitude of <span
class="math inline">\(S_s(\omega)\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\((1+N\chi_i)^2\)</span>, while at high frequency,
sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These results suggest simple
and robust experimental tests of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem in
magnetic systems that may be useful in distinguishing bulk from surface
effects.</p>

class="math inline">\(^{\prime\prime}\)</span> phonon modes, biaxial
strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by
activating hole-phonon A<span
class="math inline">\(^{\prime}\)</span>-mediated scattering channels.
By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering
rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths
toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route
to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide
monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for
further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved
spectroscopic studies.</p>
