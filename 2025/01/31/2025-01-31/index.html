<p>Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and
topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental
challenge across a wide range of systems. Here we investigate the
viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels--a model system for physical
networks with limited valence--by coupling rheology measurements,
confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that
these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops
within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating
network-within-network structure. Below the overlapping concentration,
the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the
high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher
concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by
the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our
findings highlight the emergence of ‘topological elasticity' as a
previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and
gels and inform the design of topologically controllable material
behaviours.</p>

<p>All-solid-state batteries offer high-energy-density and eco-friendly
energy storage but face commercial hurdles due to dendrite formation,
especially with lithium metal anodes. Here we report that dendrite
formation in
Li/Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/Li batteries
occurs via two distinct mechanisms, using non-invasive solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging.
Tracer-exchange nuclear magnetic resonance shows non-uniform Li plating
at electrode-electrolyte interfaces and local Li<sup>+</sup> reduction
at Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> grain
boundaries. In situ magnetic resonance imaging reveals rapid dendrite
formation via non-uniform Li plating, followed by sluggish bulk dendrite
nucleation from Li<sup>+</sup> reduction, with an intervening period of
stalled growth. Formation of amorphous dendrites and subsequent
crystallization, the defect chemistry of solid electrolytes and battery
operating conditions play a critical role in shaping the complex
interplay between the two mechanisms. Overall, this work deepens our
understanding of dendrite formation in solid-state Li batteries and
provides comprehensive insight that might be valuable for mitigating
dendrite-related challenges.</p>

<p>Social animals live in groups and interact volitionally in complex
ways. However, little is known about neural responses under such natural
conditions. Here, we investigated hippocampal CA1 neurons in a mixed-sex
group of five to 10 freely behaving wild Egyptian fruit bats that lived
continuously in a laboratory-based cave and formed a stable social
network. In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated
and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social
interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During
active observation, neurons encoded the bat's own position and head
direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of
multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat
across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex,
hierarchy, and social affiliation. Thus, hippocampal neurons form a
multidimensional sociospatial representation of the natural world.</p>

<p>Itch is a dominant symptom in dermatitis, and scratching promotes
cutaneous inflammation, thereby worsening disease. However, the
mechanisms through which scratching exacerbates inflammation and whether
scratching provides benefit to the host are largely unknown. We found
that scratching was required for skin inflammation in mouse models
dependent on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. Scratching-induced
inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide
substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also
increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to
superficial <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection. Thus, through the
activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both
exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from <i>S.
aureus</i>, reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as
a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.</p>

<p>We lack tools to edit DNA sequences at scales necessary to study 99%
of the human genome that is noncoding. To address this gap, we applied
CRISPR prime editing to insert recombination handles into repetitive
sequences, up to 1697 per cell line, which enables generating
large-scale deletions, inversions, translocations, and circular DNA.
Recombinase induction produced more than 100 stochastic megabase-sized
rearrangements in each cell. We tracked these rearrangements over time
to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter
variants that avoided essential genes. We characterized 29 clones with
multiple rearrangements, finding an impact of deletions on expression of
genes in the variant but not on nearby genes. This genome-scrambling
strategy enables large deletions, sequence relocations, and the
insertion of regulatory elements to explore genome dispensability and
organization.</p>

<p>Studying the functional consequences of structural variants (SVs) in
mammalian genomes is challenging because (i) SVs arise much less
commonly than single-nucleotide variants or small indels and (ii)
methods to generate, map, and characterize SVs in model systems are
underdeveloped. To address these challenges, we developed
Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and
mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, and
extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also
demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell
transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SV impact on gene
expression. We anticipate that Genome-Shuffle-seq will be broadly useful
for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on
gene expression, the chromatin landscape, and three-dimensional nuclear
architecture, while also initiating a path toward a minimal mammalian
genome.</p>

<p>Highly concentrated solutions of asymmetric semiconductor magic-sized
clusters (MSCs) of cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and cadmium
telluride were directed through a controlled drying meniscus front,
resulting in the formation of chiral MSC assemblies. This process
aligned their transition dipole moments and produced chiroptic films
with exceptionally strong circular dichroism. <i>G</i>-factors reached
magnitudes as high as 1.30 for drop-cast films and 1.06 for patterned
films, approaching theoretical limits. By controlling the evaporation
geometry, various domain shapes and sizes were achieved, with homochiral
domains exceeding 6 square millimeters that transition smoothly between
left- and right-handed chirality. Our results uncovered fundamental
relationships between meniscus deposition processes, the alignment of
supramolecular filaments and their MSC constituents, and their
connection to emergent chiral properties.</p>

<p>Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows sharing secret keys
among multiple distant users and plays a crucial role in quantum
networks. Because of the fragility and low generation rate of genuine
multipartite entangled states required in QCC, realizing and extending
QCC with the entanglement-based protocol is challenging.
Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QCC, which removes all detector
side channels, is a feasible long-distance quantum communication scheme
to practically generate multipartite correlation with multiphoton
projection measurement. Here we experimentally realize the three-user
MDI QCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we
employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental
feasibility of the MDI QCC, which lays the foundation for the future
realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication
tasks.</p>

<p>We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to
differentiate between cosmological models, and implemented lime as an
interpretability approach to identify the key features influencing our
model's decisions. We show the potential of NNs to enhance the
extraction of meaningful information from cosmological large-scale
structure data, based on current galaxy-clustering survey
specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter
(<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\Lambda }\mathrm{CDM}\)</span>)
model and the Hu-Sawicki <span class="math inline">\(f(R)\)</span>

class="math inline">\(f(R)\)</span> models, by predicting the correct
model with approximately 97% overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that
NNs can maximize the potential of current and next generation surveys to
probe for deviations from general relativity.</p>

<p>The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation
of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (<span
class="math inline">\(3+1\)</span>)-dimensional space-time. However, the
partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is
represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized
conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the
Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out, in a simple model, that
Lorentz-invariant observables become classical as one removes the
infrared cutoff and that this ''classicalization'' is actually an
artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome
this problem, we propose a natural way to ''gauge-fix'' the Lorentz
symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. Thus, we arrive at a new
definition of the type IIB matrix model, which also enables us to
perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time evolution can
be extracted from the generated configurations.</p>

<p>Fermionic atoms in a large-scale, homogeneous optical lattice provide
an ideal quantum simulator for investigating the fermionic Hubbard
model, yet achieving this remains challenging. Here, by developing a
hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an
optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of
three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across
approximately <span class="math inline">\(8\times{}{10}^{5}\)</span>
lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a
well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the
theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard
model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we
precisely measure the doublon fraction <span

<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and temperature <span

<p>Biphotons and single photons with narrow bandwidths and long
coherence times are essential to the realization of long-distance
quantum communication (LDQC) and linear optical quantum computing
(LOQC). In this Letter, we manipulate the biphoton wave functions of the
spontaneous four-wave mixing in a two-level atomic ensemble with a
single-laser pump scheme. Our innovative experimental approach enables
the generation of biphotons with a sub-MHz bandwidth of 0.36 MHz, a
record spectral brightness of <span
class="math inline">\(2.28\times{}{10}^{7}\text{ }\text{
}{\mathrm{s}}^{- 1}\text{ }{\mathrm{mW}}^{- 1}\text{ }{\mathrm{MHz}}^{-

depth. The strong nonclassical cross-correlation of the biphotons also
enables the observation of heralded sub-MHz-linewidth single photons
with a pronounced single-photon nature. The generation of
sub-MHz-linewidth biphotons and single photons with a two-level atomic
ensemble not only finds applications in quantum repeaters and large
cluster states for LDQC and LOQC but also opens up the opportunity to
miniaturize the biphoton or single-photon sources for chip-scale quantum
technologies.</p>

<p>Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) is an electromagnetic radiation
generated by the motion of free electrons in close to a periodic
structure. Over the past 70 years, there has been significant interest
in the generation of light in three-dimensional (3D) free space through
SPR. Here, by using the interaction between moving electrons and a
designed metallic nanoaperture array, the observation of two-dimensional
(2D) SPR, e.g., the plasmon polaritons propagating on metal surfaces, is
presented. This phenomenon was confirmed using cathodoluminescence under
grazing incidence, by decoupling 2D SPR with specially designed optical
grating into far field. Moreover, by utilizing the phased array radar
effect in 2D, the radiation direction of 2D SPR is demonstrated to be
manipulated by rotating the aperture orientation. This work not only
expands our understanding of SPR from the 3D to 2D, but also provides a
practical approach for controlling the propagation of 2D SPR.</p>

<p>The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables
electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating
nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although
recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid
theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena
only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent
to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the
materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach
it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength
between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the
conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an
explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve
maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal
regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with
intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and
numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal
designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our
findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum
interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical
design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and
electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable
the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power
of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient
of dielectric laser accelerators.</p>

<p>The quantum interaction between free electrons and photons is
fundamental to free-electron-based light sources and free-electron
quantum optics applications. A large coupling between free electrons and
photons is generally desired. In this Letter, I obtain the upper bound
for the quantum coupling between free electrons and photons. The upper
bound has a straightforward expression and can be applied to a broad
range of optical materials, especially widely used low-loss photonic
materials. The upper bound depends on the optical medium, the
free-electron velocity, and the separation between the free electron and
the optical medium. With simple structures, the numerically calculated
coupling coefficient can reach <span class="math inline">\(\sim
99%\)</span> of the upper bound. This study provides simple and
practical guidance to reach the strong coupling between free electrons
and photons.</p>

<p>We experimentally demonstrate the real-time detection and control of
correlated charge tunneling in a dynamically driven quantum dot.
Specifically, we measure the joint distribution of waiting times between
tunneling charges and show that the waiting times for holes may be
strongly correlated due to the periodic drive and the Coulomb
interactions on the dot, although the electron waiting times are not.
Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model
that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated
tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations
can be controlled by the drive. Our experiment paves the way for
systematic real-time investigations of correlated electron transport in
low-dimensional nanostructures.</p>

<p>Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic
degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular
dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the
displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices,
contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively
screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted
bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases,
optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude
of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical
contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly
modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies
based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore
systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced
pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the
interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic
applications.</p>

<p>We define and study a long-range version of the xx model, arising as
the free-fermion point of the xxz-type Haldane-Shastry (HS) chain. It
has a description via nonunitary fermions, based on the free-fermion
Temperley-Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\mathfrak{l}(1|1)\)</span> spin chain.
Even and odd lengths behave very differently; we focus on odd length.
The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting
Hamiltonians. While nonunitary, their spectrum is real by PT symmetry.
One Hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is
parity invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear
branches, realizing a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice.
The appropriate fermionic modes arise from ''quasi-translation''
symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model
exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even
more ''extended symmetry'' and larger degeneracies.</p>

<p>The doped Hubbard model is one of the paradigmatic platforms to
engineer exotic quantum many-body states, including charge-ordered
states, strange metals, and unconventional superconductors. While
undoped and doped correlated phases have been experimentally realized in
a variety of twisted van der Waals materials, experiments in monolayer
materials, and in particular <span class="math inline">\(1T\)</span>
transition metal dichalcogenides, have solely reached the conventional
insulating undoped regime. Correlated phases in monolayer
two-dimensional materials have much higher associated energy scales than
their twisted counterparts, making doped correlated monolayers an
attractive platform for high temperature correlated quantum matter.
Here, we demonstrate the realization of a doped Mott phase in a van der
Waals dichalcogenide <span class="math inline">\(1T\text{-
}{\mathrm{NbSe}}_{2}\)</span> monolayer. The system is electron doped
due to electron transfer from a monolayer van der Waals substrate via
proximity, leading to a correlated triangular lattice with both
half-filled and fully filled sites. We analyze the distribution of the
half-filled and filled sites and show the arrangement is unlikely to be
controlled by disorder alone, and we show that the presence of competing
nonlocal many-body correlations would account for the charge
correlations found experimentally. Our results establish <span

<p>Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters
with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains
a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory that systematically
incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field
theory for polymers. The theory is applied to polyelectrolyte brushes to
explain abnormal phenomena observed in recent experiments. We show that
ion correlations induce a nonmonotonic change of the brush height:
collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the
origin as the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to
translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We
also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush
collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic
potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase
separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the
normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are
in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the
literature.</p>

<p>Understanding the structural dynamics of many-particle glassy systems
remains a key challenge in statistical physics. Over the last decade,
glassy dynamics has also been reported in biological tissues, but is far
from being understood. It was recently shown that vertex models of dense
biological tissue exhibit very atypical, sub-Arrhenius dynamics, and
here we ask whether such atypical structural dynamics of vertex models
are related to unusual elastic properties. It is known that at zero
temperature these models have an elasticity controlled by their
underconstrained or isostatic nature, but little is known about how
their elasticity varies with temperature. To address this question we
investigate the 2D Voronoi model and measure the temperature dependence
of the intermediate-time plateau shear modulus and the bulk modulus. We
find that unlike in conventional glass formers, these moduli increase
monotonically with temperature until the system fluidizes. We further
show that the structural relaxation time can be quantitatively linked to
the plateau shear modulus <span class="math inline">\({G}_{p}\)</span>,
i.e. <span class="math inline">\({G}_{p}\)</span> modulates the typical
energy barrier scale for cell rearrangements. This suggests that the
anomalous, structural dynamics of the 2D Voronoi model originates in its
unusual elastic properties. Based on our results, we hypothesize that
underconstrained systems might more generally give rise to a new class
of ''ultrastrong'' glass formers.</p>

<p>The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators
make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic
memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular
momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we
study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that
the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up
to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological
insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that
each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger
than the <span class="math inline">\(\hbar/2\)</span> carried by its
spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological
insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful
engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin
conversion.</p>

<p>Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling
nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of
quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control
of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal
breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general
principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using
chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring
resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we
show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting
diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their
skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities
at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson
junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities
offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum
circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important
contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum
electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</p>

<p>We numerically investigate the athermal creep deformation of
amorphous materials having a wide range of stability. The imposed shear
stress serves as the control parameter, allowing us to examine the
time-dependent transient response through both the macroscopic strain
and microscopic observables. Least stable samples exhibit monotonicity
in the transient strain rate versus time, while more stable samples
display a pronounced non-monotonic S-shaped curve, corresponding to
failure by sharp shear band formation. We identify a diverging timescale
associated with the fluidization process and extract the corresponding
critical exponents. Our results are compared with predictions from
existing scaling theories relevant to soft matter systems. The numerical
findings for stable, brittle-like materials represent a challenge for
theoretical descriptions. We monitor the microscopic initiation of shear
bands during creep responses. Our study encompasses creep deformation
across a variety of materials ranging from ductile soft matter to
brittle metallic and oxide glasses, all within the same numerical
framework.</p>

<p>Efficient manipulation of energy at the nanoscale is crucial for
advancements in modern computing, energy harvesting, and thermal
management. Specifically, controlling quasiparticle currents is critical
to these ongoing technological revolutions. This work introduces a novel
and physically consistent approach for computing polarization-resolved
transmission functions, a crucial element in understanding and
controlling energy transport across interfaces. We show that this new
method, unlike several previously derived formulations, consistently
yields physically meaningful results by addressing the origin of
unphysical behavior in other methods. We demonstrate that while multiple
decompositions of the transmission function are possible, only there is
a unique and unambiguous route to obtaining physically meaningful
results. We highlight and critique the arbitrary nature of these
alternative decompositions and their associated failures. While
developed within the framework of phonon transport, the individual
Caroli formula is general and applicable to other fermionic and bosonic
quasiparticles, including electrons, and to internal degrees of freedom
such as spin and orbital polarization. Through a comparative analysis
using a simple model system, we validate the accuracy and reliability of
the individual Caroli formula in capturing polarization-specific
transmission properties. This new method provides a more accurate
understanding of both phonon and electron transport, offering novel ways
for optimization of thermoelectric devices and energy-efficient
computing technologies.</p>

<p>We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators
electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining
piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra
with scanning-laser-Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of
resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The
investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly
clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive
characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to
<span class="math inline">\(2\times10^5\)</span> are found at room
temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrquencies
exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's
modulus in agreement with literature. These findings are robust under
post-processing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and
high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality
mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a
broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture
meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on
the upcoming SiC platform.</p>

<p>Lipid bilayers often form high-curvature configurations due to
self-assembly conditions or certain biological processes. However,
particle-based simulations of lipid membranes are predominantly of flat
lipid membranes because planar membranes are easily connected over
periodic boundary conditions. To simulate a curved lipid membrane, one
can simulate an entire vesicle, a cylinder, or a bicelle (disk-like
bilayer aggregate). One can also use artificial methods to control
curvature, such as applying virtual walls of beads, radial harmonic
potentials, or
<code>tape up the edges''. These existing methods have limitations due to the method by which curvature is imposed. Herein, we propose an alternative method of introducing arbitrary curvature by anchoring a curved lipid membrane with</code>frozen''
equilibrated membrane patches. The method presented here is compatible
with all particle-based lipid models and easily extended to many
geometries. As an example, we simulate curved membranes with DPPC, DOPC,
DLPC and DOPE lipids as parameterized by the Martini3 coarse-grained
model. This method introduces limited finite-size artifacts, prevents
lipid flip-flop at membrane edges, and allows fluctuations of the free
membrane center. We provide verification of the method on flat membranes
and discussion on extracting shape and per-leaflet quantities
(thickness, order parameter) from curved membranes. Curvature produces
asymmetric changes in lipid leaflet properties. Finally, we explore the
coupled effect of curvature and membrane asymmetry in both number and
lipid type. We report the resulting unique morphologies (inducing gel
phase, faceting) and behaviors (thickness dependent on adjacent leaflet
type) that are accessible with this method.</p>

<p>Thermodynamics with internal variables is a common approach in
continuum mechanics to model inelastic (i.e., non-equilibrium) material
behavior. While this approach is computationally and theoretically
attractive, it currently lacks a well-established statistical mechanics
foundation. As a result, internal variables are typically chosen
phenomenologically and lack a direct link to the underlying physics
which hinders the predictability of the theory. To address these
challenges, we propose a machine learning approach that is consistent
with the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The
proposed approach leverages the following techniques (i) the information
bottleneck (IB) method to ensure that the learned internal variables are
functions of the microstates and are capable of capturing the salient
feature of the microscopic distribution; (ii) conditional normalizing
flows to represent arbitrary probability distributions of the
microscopic states as functions of the state variables; and (iii)
Variational Onsager Neural Networks (VONNs) to guarantee thermodynamic
consistency and Markovianity of the learned evolution equations. The
resulting framework, called IB-VONNs, is tested on two problems of
colloidal systems, governed at the microscale by overdamped Langevin
dynamics. The first one is a prototypical model for a colloidal particle
in an optical trap, which can be solved analytically, and thus ideal to
verify the framework. The second problem is a one-dimensional
phase-transforming system, whose macroscopic description still lacks a
statistical mechanics foundation under general conditions. The results
in both cases indicate that the proposed machine learning strategy can
indeed bridge statistical mechanics and thermodynamics with internal
variables away from equilibrium.</p>

<p>Tailoring material properties often requires understanding the
solidification process. Herein, we introduce the geometric descriptor
Soliquidy, which numerically captures the Euclidean transport cost
between the translationally disordered versus ordered states of a
materials. As a testbed, we apply Soliquidy to the classification of
glass-forming metal alloys. By extending and combining an experimental
library of metallic thin-films (glass/no-glass) with the this http URL
computational database (geometrical and energetic information of
mixtures) we found that the combination of Soliquity and formation
enthalpies generates an effective classifier for glass formation. Such
classifier is then used to tackle a public dataset of metallic glasses
showing that the glass-agnostic assumptions of Soliquity can be useful
for understanding kinetically-controlled phase transitions.</p>

<p>High-quality electrostatic gating is a fundamental ingredient for
successful semiconducting device physics, and a key element of realizing
clean quantum transport. Inspired by the widespread improvement of
transport quality when two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials are
gated exclusively by other vdW materials, we have developed a method for
gating non-vdW materials with an all-vdW gate stack, consisting of a
hexagonal boron nitride dielectric layer and a few-layer graphite gate
electrode. We demonstrate this gating approach on MOVPE-grown InSb
nanoribbons (NRs), a novel variant of the InSb nanowire, with a
flattened cross-section. In our all-vdW gated NR devices we observe
conductance features that are reproducible and have low- to near-zero
gate hysteresis. We also report quantized conductance, which persists to
lower magnetic fields and longer channel lengths than typical InSb
nanowire devices reported to date. Additionally, we observe level
splitting that is highly anisotropic in an applied magnetic field, which
we attribute to the ribbon cross-section. The performance of our devices
is consistent with the reduced disorder expected from the all-vdW gating
scheme, and marks the first report of ballistic, few-modes quantum
transport in a non-vdW material with an all-vdW gate. Our results
establish all-vdW gating as a promising approach for high-quality gating
of non-vdW materials for quantum transport, which is in principle
applicable generically, beyond InSb systems. In addition, the work
showcases the specific potential of all-vdW gate/InSb NR devices for
enabling clean quantum devices that may be relevant for spintronics and
topological superconductivity studies.</p>

<p>To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials
design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced
representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations
of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need
is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through
additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical
microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the
conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials.
Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at
the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately
predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the
physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features.
This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via
variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical
mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method
offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures.
We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured
alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information
and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not
directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced
microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning
models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately
predicting their properties.</p>

<p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the frustrated quantum spin
systems occasionally suffer from the negative sign problem, which makes
simulations exponentially harder for larger systems at lower
temperatures and severely limits QMC's application across a wide range
of spin systems. This problem is known to depend on the choice of
representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating
the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice
structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize
the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the
existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function,
which effectively approximates negativity, especially in
frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we
demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the
negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and
other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the
effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal
transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively
mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</p>

<p>The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of
light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the
orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to
investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF
thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s
core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a
p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization
axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at
variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the
coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence
lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a
phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies.
The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to
the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR
probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright
exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe
polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states
is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal
associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This
interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system,
as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results
indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental
tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in
solid-state materials.</p>

<p>Crystallization of biological molecules has high potential to solve
some challenges in drug manufacturing. Thus, understanding the process
is critical to efficiently adapting crystallization to biopharmaceutical
manufacturing. This article describes phase behavior for the solution
crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids of
serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as model biological macromolecular assemblies.
Hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments are used to determine the
combined effects of pH and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride
concentrations in which full and empty capsids nucleate and grow. Full
and empty capsids show different crystallization behavior although they
possess similar capsid structure and similar outer morphology with
icosahedral symmetry and 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry. The
differential charge environment surrounding full and empty capsids is
found to influence capsid crystallization. The crystal growth rate is
found to be affected by the mass of the macromolecular assembly rather
than the structure/shape of the macromolecular assembly. The regions of
precipitant concentrations and pH in which crystallization occurs are
found to be different for different rAAV serotypes and for full and
empty capsids for each serotype. Depending on the precipitant
concentrations and the rAAV serotype, a variety of complex crystal
morphologies are formed and a variety of non-crystallization outcomes
such as unidentified dense solid-phase/opaque crystals and an oil/dense
phase is observed. The well-defined dense phase/oil is found to be
converted into a solid phase over a long period of time. Trends in the
crystallization of full and empty capsids between serotypes is observed
to be altered by the extent of post-translational modifications (PTMS)
associated with the massive macromolecular proteinaceous assembly.</p>

<p>We introduce a non-phenomenological framework based on the influence
functional method to incorporate simultaneous interactions of particles
with fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs. In the slow-motion limit,
the electronic friction kernel becomes Markovian, enabling an analytical
expression for the friction coefficient. The framework is applied to a
prototypical electrochemical system, where the metal electrode and
solvent act as fermionic and bosonic reservoirs, respectively. We
investigate quantum vibrational relaxation of hydrogen on metal
surfaces, showing that dissipation to electron-hole pairs reduces the
relaxation time. Additionally, in solvated proton discharge, electronic
friction prolongs charge transfer by delaying proton transitions between
potential wells. This study provides new insights into the interplay of
solvent and electronic dissipation effects, with direct relevance to
electrochemical processes and other systems involving multiple thermal
reservoirs.</p>

<p>Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) for materials have
demonstrated that "simple" materials representations (e.g., the chemical
formula alone without structural information) can sometimes achieve
competitive property prediction performance in common-tasks. Our
physics-based intuition would suggest that such representations are
"incomplete", which indicates a gap in our understanding. This work
proposes a tomographic interpretation of structure-property relations of
materials to bridge that gap by defining what is a material
representation, material properties, the material and the relationships
between these three concepts using ideas from information theory. We
verify this framework performing an exhaustive comparison of
property-augmented representations on a range of material's property
prediction objectives, providing insight into how different properties
can encode complementary information.</p>

<p>Excitonic insulators represent a unique quantum phase of matter,
providing a rich ground for studying exotic quantum bosonic states.
Strongly coupled electron-hole bilayers, which host stable dipolar
exciton fluids with an exciton density that can be adjusted
electrostatically, offer an ideal platform to investigate correlated
excitonic insulators. Based on electron-hole bilayers made of
MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic
insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation
of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and
electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong
magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between
the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator
phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole
interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities
for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.</p>

<p>Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most
extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals
crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional
(2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of
the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a
transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to
the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched
between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence
quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage
between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance
of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D
materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy
remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This
stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various
van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

<p>Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount
interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter
excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic
properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is
possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the
interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here
we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic
condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake
embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose
condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like
behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second
order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is
highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign
change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our
findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids
of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to
on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

<p>Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a novel class
of topological materials, characterised by the emergence of topological
boundary modes at dimensions two or more lower than those of bulk
materials. Recent experimental studies have identified conducting
channels at the hinges of HOTIs, although their topological nature
remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated Shapiro steps in
Al-WTe<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>-Al proximity Josephson
junctions (JJs) under microwave irradiation and examined the topological
properties of the hinge states in WTe<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>. Specifically, we analysed the
microwave frequency dependence of the absence of the first Shapiro step
in hinge-dominated JJs, attributing this phenomenon to the 4<span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>-periodic current-phase relationship
characteristic of topological JJs. These findings may encourage further
research into topological superconductivity with topological hinge
states in superconducting hybrid devices based on HOTIs. Such advances
could lead to the realisation of Majorana zero modes for topological
quantum physics and pave the way for applications in spintronic
devices.</p>

<p>We introduce new models that incorporate layer corrugation and
interface roughness into standard approaches for measuring interface
stress in nanomultilayers (NMLs). Applied to Cu/W NMLs, these models
show that ignoring such features can inflate measured interface stress
by up to 0.4 J/m^2. However, corrugation and roughness alone cannot
account for the extreme stresses reported, suggesting that atomic-scale
phenomena (e.g., intermixing and metastable phase formation at the
interfaces) dominate. These findings highlight the importance of
balancing bilayer counts and thickness-to-roughness ratios for reliable
stress quantification, providing a practical pathway to designing and
characterizing advanced nanocomposite coatings with improved
accuracy.</p>

<p>The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) realized in two-dimensional
electron systems is explained by the emergent composite fermions (CF)
out of ordinary electrons. It is possible to write down explicit
wavefunctions explaining many if not all FQHE states. In bilayer systems
there is a regime at integer filling of the lowest Landau level that
displays a spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) relative phase between the
two layers. This can be seen as interlayer phase coherence (ILC) in
terms of electrons. Recent experiments in double layer samples of
graphene have revealed the appearance of many FQHE states unique to the
bilayer case. We discuss extensions of the CF idea in this situation as
well as the possible existence of ILC of CFs.</p>

<p>Vortex states in thin film disks host spin wave modes that are
geometrically quantized according to their radial and azimuthal indices.
Previous studies have shown that hybridization between these modes and
the vortex core results in a sizeable frequency nonreciprocity between
low-order clockwise and counterclockwise propagating azimuthal modes.
Here, we present a computational study of these spin wave modes in
submicron disks in which the spatial extension of the vortex core
becomes comparable to the wavelength of certain modes. In such cases, we
find that the frequency nonreciprocity can be large even for higher
order radial and azimuthal indices, reaching several GHz and comparable
to the mode frequencies themselves.</p>

state methods are presented that have the potential to broaden their
scope of application radically for strongly correlated molecular
systems. These include global fermionic mode optimization, i.e., a
general approach to find an optimal matrix product state (MPS)
parametrization of a quantum many-body wave function with the minimum
number of parameters for a given error margin, the restricted active
space DMRG-RAS-X method, multi-orbital correlations and entanglement,
developments on hybrid CPU-multiGPU parallelization, and an efficient
treatment of non-Abelian symmetries on high-performance computing (HPC)
infrastructures. Scaling analysis on NVIDIA DGX-A100 platform is also

<p>Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and
controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential
cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their
preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane
curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical
development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The
mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane
deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the
area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered
protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the
crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily
proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent
excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and
generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused
by protein binding and colloidal particle adhesion are reviewed,
including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.</p>

<p>While mutually interacting spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) hold
great promise for wireless communication, neural networks, neuromorphic
computing, and Ising machines, the highest number of synchronized SHNOs
remains limited to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 64. Using
ultra-narrow 10 and 20-nm nano-constrictions in W-Ta/CoFeB/MgO
trilayers, we demonstrate mutually synchronized SHNO networks of up to
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 105,000. The microwave power
and quality factor scale as <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> with
new record values of 9 nW and <span class="math inline">\(1.04 \times

dependence of the frequency-current tunability is explained by magnon
exchange between nano-constrictions and magnon losses at the array
edges, further corroborated by micromagnetic simulations and Brillouin
light scattering microscopy. Our results represent a significant step
towards viable SHNO network applications in wireless communication and
unconventional computing.</p>

<p>The destruction of metallicity due to the mutual Coulomb interaction
of quasiparticles gives rise to fascinating phenomena of solid state
physics such as the Mott metal-insulator transition and the pseudogap. A
key observable characterizing their occurrences is the single-particle
spectral function, determined by the fermionic self-energy. In this
paper we investigate in detail how real space fluctuations are
responsible for a self-energy that drives the Mott-Hubbard
metal-insulator transition. To this aim we first introduce a real space
fluctuation diagnostics approach to the Hedin equation, which connects
the fermion-boson coupling vertex <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> to the self-energy <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. Second, by using cellular
dynamical mean-field theory calculations for <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> we identify the leading physical
processes responsible for the destruction of metallicity across the
transition.</p>

<p>Single-beam acoustical tweezers are used to manipulate individual
microbubbles and provide quantitative measurements of the local shear
modulus of soft hydrogels. The microbubbles are directly generated by
electrolysis of the hydrogel and their displacement is detected using
optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam.
Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial
force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also
observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the
transfer of the beam's angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for
the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations

found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed
with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are
relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of
complex soft materials opening new opportunities in the field of active

<p>Phase change materials are the most promising candidates for the
realization of artificial synapsis for neuromorphic computing. Different
resistance levels corresponding to analogic values of the synapsis
conductance can be achieved by modulating the size of an amorphous
region embedded in its crystalline matrix. Recently, it has been
proposed that a superlattice made of alternating layers of the phase
change compound Sb<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>Te<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> and of the TiTe<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> confining material allows for a better
control of multiple intermediate resistance states and for a lower drift
with time of the electrical resistance of the amorphous phase. In this
work, we consider to substitute Sb<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>Te<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> with the Ge<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>Sb<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>Te<span
class="math inline">\(_5\)</span> prototypical phase change compound
that should feature better data retention. By exploiting molecular
dynamics simulations with a machine learning interatomic potential, we

nanoconfinement induces a slight reduction in the crystal growth

nucleation rate due to heterogeneous nucleation. The results support the

<p>In recent years, significant advancements in computational methods
have dramatically enhanced the precision in determining the energetic
ranking of different phases of molecular crystals. The developments
mainly focused on providing accurate dispersion corrected exchange
correlation functionals and methods for describing the vibrational
entropy contributions to the free energy at finite temperatures. Several
molecular crystals phases were recently found to have of multi-minima
character. For our investigations we highlight the multi-minima
character in the example of the molecular crystal consisting of
N-(4-Methylbenzylidene)-4-methylalanine. We explore its potential energy
landscape on the full DFT level or with a machine learned potential that
was fitted to DFT data. We calculate not only many local minima but also
exact barriers along transformation pathways to demonstrate the
multi-minima character of our system. Furthermore, we present a
framework, based on the quantum superposition method, that includes both
configurational and vibrational entropy. As an example, we show for our
system that the transition temperature between two of its phases is
afflicted by an error of about 200 K if the multi-minima character is
not taken into account. This indicates that it is absolutely essential
to consider configurational entropy to obtain reliable finite
temperature free energy rankings for complex molecular crystals.</p>

<p>Heat transport in low-dimensional solids can significantly differ
from their bulk counterpart due to various size-related effects. This
offers rich heat transport phenomena to emerge. However, finding an
appropriate thermometry method for thermal conductivity measurements at
the reduced size and dimensionality of the samples is a challenge. Here,
we propose and study the feasibility of a nanoscale resolution thermal
conductivity measurement method based on bolometric thermometry
implemented on an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The local heat exchange
between the AFM tip and the sample occurs at a suspended section of the
sample, and thermal modeling of the measured electrical resistance
change resulting from the bolometric effect provides a unique value for
thermal conductivity. As we illustrate via thermal simulations, the
proposed method can measure thermal conductivity with thermal
disturbance to the sample in as little as 0.2 K at ~20 nm lateral
resolution. Our in-depth analysis shows the feasibility and extensive
applicability of the proposed AFM-based bolometric thermometry method on
low-dimensional materials both in diffusive and ballistic heat transport
regimes from cryogenic to above-room temperature. Consequently, the
proposed method can lead to a deeper experimental understanding of
fundamental questions in nanoscale and low-dimensional heat transport
phenomena in many different material classes, as well as Fourier and
non-Fourier heat transfer regimes.</p>

<p>Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is
characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities,
drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including
thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for
deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this
paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable
tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems
with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm,
moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of
nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing
conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of
local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework
guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems
with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless
of system size.</p>

<p>Contactless, laser-based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy was
utilized to monitor changes in elastic properties in single-crystalline
NiTi shape memory alloy. It was observed that the elastic behavior of
the temperature-induced B19<span class="math inline">\(^\prime\)</span>
martensite adopts the symmetry elements of the parent austenite phase,
and thus, the changes over the transformation temperature can be
represented by the temperature evolution of three cubic elastic
coefficients. The experiments confirm that the transition during the
cooling run is preceded by pronounced softening of the <span
class="math inline">\(c_{44}\)</span> elastic coefficient, which leads
to nearly complete vanishing of elastic anisotropy prior to the
transition. Below the transition, this coefficient remains soft, and the
character of anisotropy switches from <span

<p>In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical
irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer and
Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or
external irreversibility, yielding well-known expressions for the
efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for
endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible
model. Within the Constant Properties model, we formulate a scenario
that incorporates internal as well as external irreversibilities
simultaneously. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small
external irreversibility (SEI), confining to the regime where the
external conductance of the heat exchangers is large in comparison to
the internal thermal conductance of the thermoelectric material. This
approach allows us to derive a general expression for EMP, which depends
on the ratio of internal to external conductance, apart from the figure
of merit and ratio of temperatures. Extending our study to
thermoelectric refrigerators under the similar assumptions, we also
analyze the efficiency at maximum cooling power.</p>

<p>The creation and control of magnetic spin textures is of great
interest in fundamental research and future device-oriented
applications. Fe/Gd multilayers host a rich variety of magnetic textures
including topologically trivial bubbles and topologically protected
skyrmions. Using time-resolved Kerr spectroscopy, we highlight how
various control strategies, including temperature, out-of-plane magnetic
fields and femtosecond light excitation, can be used to create such
textures via different pathways. We find that varying the magnetic field
for constant temperature leads to a different (<span
class="math inline">\(H, T\)</span>)-phase diagram of magnetic textures
than moving along a temperature trajectory for constant magnetic field.
Micromagnetic simulations corroborate this finding and allow to
visualize the different paths taken. Furthermore, we show that the
creation of bubbles and skyrmions in this material via impulsive light
excitation is not solely governed by temperature-driven processes, since
bubbles and skyrmions can be stabilized in parts of the (<span
class="math inline">\(H, T\)</span>)-phase diagram, where neither the
constant temperature nor the constant magnetic field trajectory predict
their existence. Using this phase diagram, we reason why bubble and
skyrmion creation in this particular system is only possible from the
stripe domain state. Our observations provide a versatile toolkit for
tailoring the creation of magnetic spin textures in Fe/Gd
multilayers.</p>

<p>Overdamped stochastic systems maintained far from equilibrium can
display sustained oscillations with fluctuations that decrease with the
system size. The correlation time of such noisy limit cycles expressed
in units of the cycle period is upper-bounded by the entropy produced
per oscillation. We prove this constraint for first-order nonlinear
systems in arbitrary dimensions perturbed by weak, uncorrelated Gaussian
noise. We then extend the result to important examples of more general
stochastic dynamics, including electronic and chemical clocks,
illustrating the practical relevance of the dissipation-coherence bound
for electronic computing and thermodynamic inference.</p>

<p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts luminescent defects possessing
spin qualities compatible with quantum sensing protocols at room
temperature. Vacancies, in particular, are readily obtained via exposure
to high-energy ion beams. While the defect creation mechanism via such
irradiation is well understood, the occurrence rate of optically active
negatively charged vacancies (<span
class="math inline">\(V_B^-\)</span>) is an open question. In this work,
we exploit focused helium ions to systematically generate optically
active vacancy defects in hBN flakes at varying density. By comparing
the density-dependent spin splitting measured by magnetic resonance to
calculations based on a microscopic charge model, in which we introduce
a correction term due to a constant background charge, we are able to
quantify the number of <span class="math inline">\(V_B^-\)</span>
defects generated by the ion irradiation. We find that only a small
fraction (0.2%) of all vacancies is in the optically active, negatively
charged state. Our results provide a protocol for measuring the
generation efficiency of <span class="math inline">\(V_B^-\)</span>,
which is necessary for understanding and optimizing luminescent centers
in hBN.</p>

<p>Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under
nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of
selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive
media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes
or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows
such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in
the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups,
the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force
also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is
therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate
the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a
low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the
system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate
different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity
constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model
systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a
single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more
sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from
3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent
friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D)
Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</p>

<p>Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted
trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard
model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic
properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We
obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac
cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions
results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard
interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene
multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state
against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride
encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of
electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands.
Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system,
revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero
Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moiré
Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a
mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control
the system's topological properties.</p>

<p>Machine learning (ML) with in situ diagnostics offers a
transformative approach to accelerate, understand, and control thin film
synthesis by uncovering relationships between synthesis conditions and
material properties. In this study, we demonstrate the application of
deep learning to predict the stoichiometry of Sr<span

high-energy electron diffraction images acquired during pulsed laser

unknown correlation between diffraction streak features and cation
stoichiometry in Sr<span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span>Ti<span

demonstrate how ML can be used to transform a ubiquitous in situ
diagnostic tool, that is usually limited to qualitative assessments,
into a quantitative surrogate measurement of continuously valued thin
film properties. Such methods are critically needed to enable real-time
control, autonomous workflows, and accelerate traditional synthesis

<p>Nonlinear helicity-dependent photocurrents have been reported in 3D
topological materials lacking inversion symmetry. Here, we theoretically
study the charge and spin photocurrents generated by linear and
circularly polarized radiation in ultrathin topological insulator films.
Using time-dependent perturbation theory and detailed balance equations,
we find that helical transverse spin currents are generated when the
symmetry between the top and bottom film surfaces is disturbed. Such
spin currents are invariant under in-plane mirror transformations but
have <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-wave and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave components in regard to
transformations under <span class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span>
rotations. Spin current photo-transistors and amplifiers can be based on
these effects.</p>

<p>The 2d ferromagnetic Ising model was solved by Onsager on the square
lattice in 1944, and an explicit expression of the free energy density
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is presently available for some

<span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> only requires a partial
derivation of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and has been
performed on many lattices, including the 11 Archimedean lattices. We
give general expressions of the free energy, energy, entropy and
specific heat for planar lattices with a single type of non-crossing

<p>Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN)
tight-binding model for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole
symmetric emergent Dirac liquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the
half-filling or zero-energy on bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic
lattices, respectively embedded on the flat and negatively curved
spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a
vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near
half-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this
scenario resulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the
opposite directions between any pair of NN sites continues to
accommodate a real eigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian
parameter regime. Most importantly, it reduces the band width without
altering the characteristic scaling of the density of states close to
the zero-energy. Here, we show that on two-dimensional bipartite
Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the
formation of both charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at
weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian
systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions, respectively. These
two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average
electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and both
cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions
by combining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based
self-consistent numerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We
discuss the scaling of the associated mass gaps near the zero-energy
with the non-Hermitian parameter, and also address the finite size
scaling of the order parameters specifically on hyperbolic lattices with
open boundary conditions. A robust general mathematical criterion for
the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for ordered phases is
showcased.</p>
