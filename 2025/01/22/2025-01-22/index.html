<p>Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) films provide a material platform
for the epitaxial growth of quantum heterostructures. However, unlike
the remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, the
growth of two-dimensional material heterostructures across atomic layers
has been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here we report the
double-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes.
We grow vdW topological insulators Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and
Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> by molecular-beam epitaxy on both surfaces
of atomically thin graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, which serve as
suspended two-dimensional vdW substrate layers. Both homo- and
hetero-double-sided vdW topological insulator tunnel junctions are
fabricated, with the atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride acting as a
crystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxial
interfaces. By performing field-angle-dependent magneto-tunnelling
spectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy-momentum-spin
resonance of massless Dirac electrons tunnelling between helical Landau
levels developed in the topological surface states at the
interfaces.</p>

<p>Cathodic corrosion is an electrochemical phenomenon that etches
metals at moderately negative potentials. Although cathodic corrosion
probably occurs by forming a metal-containing anion, such intermediate
species have not yet been observed. Here, aiming to resolve this
long-standing debate, our work provides such evidence through X-ray
absorption spectroscopy. High-energy-resolution X-ray absorption
near-edge structure experiments are used to characterize platinum
nanoparticles during cathodic corrosion in 10 mol l<sup>-1</sup> NaOH.
These experiments detect minute chemical changes in the Pt during
corrosion that match first-principles simulations of X-ray absorption
spectra of surface platinum multilayer hydrides. Thus, this work
supports the existence of hydride-like platinum during cathodic
corrosion. Notably, these results provide a direct observation of these
species under conditions where they are highly unstable and where
prominent hydrogen bubble formation interferes with most spectroscopy
methods. Therefore, this work identifies the elusive intermediate that
underlies cathodic corrosion.</p>

<p>Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed
to be among the most important applications of quantum information
processors. However, realizing practical quantum advantage for such
problems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost of
programming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce a
simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems represented
by model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architectures
to simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach also
introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral
properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results.
We develop a digital-analogue simulation toolbox for efficient
Hamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering and
hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex
spin-spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementation
based on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectral
information can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshot
measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of
excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a
single dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use the
method to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal
catalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

<p>Recent theoretical and experimental breakthroughs have given rise to
the emerging field of free-electron quantum optics, reshaping the
understanding of free-electron physics. Traditionally rooted in
classical electrodynamics, this field now reveals quantum-mechanical
features that necessitate the frameworks of quantum electrodynamics and
quantum optics. This shift compels a re-evaluation of well-established
areas, bringing quantum-mechanical corrections to accelerator science
and to electron-radiation phenomena. Simultaneously, the ability to
shape single-electron wavefunctions opens new possibilities in
microscopy and spectroscopy. These developments are primarily driven by
innovations in electron microscopy and its intersection with laser
science, where laser-driven electron modulation substantially influences
quantum electron interactions with light and matter. In this
Perspective, we review these developments, highlighting the current
challenges and future opportunities. We explore the role of the free
electron as a quantum resource, complementing conventional two-level
systems and harmonic oscillators. In the coming years, free electrons
may offer new modalities for reading and writing quantum information on
ultrafast timescales, performing quantum-state tomography, and ultrafast
quantum gates on the atomic scale.</p>

<p>Optical refrigeration, or condensed phase laser cooling, uses lasers
to remove thermal energy from solids through anti-Stokes
photoluminescence. This non-contact, vibration-free, optically
addressable cooling technique opens up many application possibilities,
ranging from high-resolution space-based imaging to the stabilization of
ultraprecise frequency combs. The field has seen rapid progress in the
past 25 years, from the first cooling of a rare-earth-doped glass by 0.3
K in 1995 to reaching cryogenic temperatures around 90 K in
ytterbium-doped fluoride crystals in 2018. Attention has now shifted to
semiconductors with higher cooling power densities and predicted cooling
floors as low as 10 K. This has stimulated a race to demonstrate the
optical refrigeration of a semiconductor. It is therefore timely to
systematize the necessary and sufficient experimental minimum criteria
for reporting optical refrigeration results to elevate the reliability
and reproducibility of current and future optical refrigeration claims.
In this Expert Recommendation, we propose four principles and provide
guidelines for verifying and reporting new cooling results: optical
cooling metrics, demonstrations of explicit heating versus cooling,
thermodynamic consistency and reliable temperature measurements. We
further propose that these principles serve as a guide for reviewing
literature claims in the field.</p>

<p>Recently, evidences of superconductivity with onset temperature <span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> above the McMillan limit (<span
class="math inline">\(\approx 40\)</span> K) have been detected in the
La<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Ni<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_7\)</span> ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO
substrate at ambient pressure. This progress makes it possible to
investigate the pairing mechanism in the bilayer nickelates through
adopting various experimental tools. Here we perform a first-principle
density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure
of this nickelate superconductor. The obtained band structure is
different from that of the pressurized bulk La<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Ni<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_7\)</span> mainly in that the bonding-<span
class="math inline">\(d_{z^2}\)</span> band is pushed far (<span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 0.16 eV) below the Fermi level.
Taking the low-energy Ni-<span
class="math inline">\((3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})\)</span> orbitals placed
on the pseudo-tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer
eight-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of
the DFT band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard
interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation approach to
investigate the pairing symmetry. The obtained spin susceptibility is
maximized at the momentum <span class="math inline">\(Q = (0,
0.86\pi)\)</span> in the folded Brillouin zone, induced by Fermi-surface
nesting, leading to interlayer antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the
diagonal double-stripe pattern similar with that reported for the bulk
La<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Ni<span

<p>A random distribution of poroelastic spheres in a poroelastic medium
obeying Biot's theory is considered. The scattering coefficients of the
fast and the slow waves are computed in the low frequency limit using
the sealed pore boundary conditions. Analytical expressions of the
effective wavenumbers of the coherent longitudinal waves (fast and slow)
are deduced the Rayleigh limit using a generalization of the
Linton-Martin (LM) formula to poroelastic medium up to the order two in
concentration. Some effective quantities (mass density, bulk modulus) of
the heterogeneous media are estimated.</p>

<p>Mechanical stress control is becoming one of the major challenges for
the future of micro and nanotechnologies. Micro scanning X-ray
diffraction is one of the promising techniques that allows stress
characterization in such complex structures at sub micron scales. Two
types of MEMS structure have been studied: a bilayer cantilever composed
of a gold film deposited on poly-silicon and a boron doped silicon
bridge. X-ray diffraction results are discussed in view of numerical
simulation experiments.</p>

<p>Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems
to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two
aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives
rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a
gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work,
we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like
microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The
direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the
axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three
lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59%
of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This
is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured
microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band
crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent
solid-state spacetime.</p>

<p>Microfluidics offer remarkable flexibility for in-flow analyte
characterization and can even measure the mechanical properties of
biological cells through the application of hydrodynamic forces. In this
work, we present a new approach to enhance the performance of
nanomechanical resonators featuring integrated microfluidic channels
when they are used as cell sensors by means of applying hydrostatic
compressions. For this purpose, we have studied analytically how this
kind of compressions affects either the mechanical properties of the
resonator as well as the analytes. We found that, depending on factors
such as device geometry and material composition, the mass limit of
detection of the resonator can be reduced while the buoyant mass of the
particles is increased when a hydrostatic compression is applied,
improving the performance of the sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that applying these hydrostatic compressions induces shifts in mass
distributions among cell lines with similar physical properties, which
not only potentially enhances the ability to differentiate between these
lines, but also opens the door to measure the cell's compressibility, a
biophysical parameter of interest with practical diagnostic
applications.</p>

<p>Pristine polycrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) --
microcrystalline (B-MCDE) and ultrananocrystalline (B-UNCDE) were
applied for the electrochemical reduction of several selected purine
nucleotides -- Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP), 2'-Deoxyguanosine
5'-monophosphate (dGMP), Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), Adenosine
5'-diphosphate (ADP), Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), and pyrimidine
nucleotides -- Cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP), Thymidine
5'-monophosphate (TMP), as well as low-molecular-weight double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) at very negative potentials via linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV). Three different types of electrode surfaces were employed --
"H-terminated" B-MCDE (H-B-MCDE) and "O-terminated" B-MCDE/B-UNCDE
(O-B-MCDE/O-B-UNCDE). It was found that electrochemical reduction of all
tested analytes (except GMP) is possible at H-B-MCDE. On the other hand,
electrochemical reduction of all selected analytes (except dsDNA) is
possible at O-B-MCDE/O-B-UNCDE. Ambient oxygen and preadsorption step in
the manner of incubation of the corresponding sensor in the analyte
solution for 30 s had a profound effect on the repeatability of the
results and, in the case of H-B-MCDE, also on the magnitude of
voltammetric signals and the possibility of electrochemical reduction of
dGMP. The use of the proposed sensors and their main advantages and
disadvantages for the voltammetric determination of the tested analytes
(demonstrated via electrochemical reduction of AMP) in the presence of
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also discussed.</p>

<p>Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields,
including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement
of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often
characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the
environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in
diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is
observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear
scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon,
fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process,
particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations.
Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous
processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In
this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional
Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM
process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To
characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool
used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive
exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous
anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify
non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those
obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence
between probability density functions. Through both analytical and
numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric
for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion
processes.</p>

<p>Alkali metal intercalation of graphene layers has been of particular
interest due to potential applications in electronics, energy storage,
and catalysis. Rubidium (Rb) is one of the largest alkali metals and the
one less investigated as intercalant. Here, we report a systematic
investigation, with a multi-technique approach, of the phase formation
of Rb under epitaxial monolayer graphene on SiC(0001). We explore a wide
phase space with two control parameters: the Rb density (i.e.,
deposition time) and sample temperature (i.e., room- and
low-temperature). We reveal the emergence of <span
class="math inline">\((2 \times 2)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})\)</span>R30° structures
formed by a single alkali metal layer intercalated between monolayer
graphene and the interfacial C-rich reconstructed surface, also known as
buffer layer. Rb intercalation also results in a strong n-type doping of
the graphene layer. Progressively annealing to high temperatures, we
first reveal diffusion of Rb atoms which results in the enlargement of
intercalated areas. As desorption sets in, intercalated regions
progressively shrink and fragment. Eventually, at approximately 600°C
the initial surface is retrieved, indicating the reversibility of the
intercalation process.</p>

<p>We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the
transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an
arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the
sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the
complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of
a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the
model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations,
along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in
terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the
problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with
independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success
probability <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span>. We employ a
combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to
characterize <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> without
restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the
Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law
behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the
laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the
cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the
driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink
number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as
revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary
nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to
the determination of <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> for an
arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding
of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden
quench limit.</p>

<p>Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify
the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application
of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an
inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence
of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the
frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special
ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can
be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with
additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of
the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios
between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a
linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel
dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization
and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances
between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate
their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium
against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This
work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and
bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</p>

<p>Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise
quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction
(LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we
first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key
observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with
the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet
precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less
than <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> compared to numerical
simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained
critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes
potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and
phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new
image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of
polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.</p>

<p>We develop a microscopic theory for the dynamics of quantum fluids of
light, deriving an effective kinetic equation in momentum space that
takes the form of the convection-diffusion equation. In the particular
case of two-dimensional systems with parabolic dispersion, it reduces to
the Bateman--Burgers equation. The hydrodynamic analogy unifies
nonlinear wave phenomena, such as shock wave formation and turbulence,
with non-equilibrium Bose--Einstein condensation of photons and
polaritons in optical cavities. We introduce the Reynolds number <span
class="math inline">\((\textit{Re})\)</span> and demonstrate that the
condensation threshold corresponds exactly to a critical Reynolds number
of unity <span class="math inline">\((\textit{Re}=1)\)</span>, beyond
which <span class="math inline">\((\textit{Re} &gt; 1)\)</span> a
shock-like front emerges in the momentum space, characterized by the
Bose--Einstein distribution for the particle density in states with high
momentum.</p>

<p>Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is
a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the
Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor
Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and
4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range
structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess
energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared
with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models
present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in
excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several
of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si
models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of
crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our
study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous
random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model
by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the
crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</p>

<p>Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer substantial theoretical energy
density gains over Li-ion bat-teries, a crucial factor for
transportation electrification. In addition, sulfur is an
earth-abundant, inexpensive material obtainable from multiple resources;
thus, Li-S batteries are envisioned to provide environmentally
sustainable solutions to the growing demand for energy storage. A
crit-ical roadblock to the realization of commercial Li-S batteries is
the formation of polysulfides and their secondary reactions with liquid
organic electrolytes, resulting in low coulombic efficiency for charging
and fast self-discharge rates. The realization of solid-state
electrolytes for Li-S bat-teries provides potential pathways to address
the safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and inhib-it the formation of
polysulfides and/or prevent their diffusion into the anode electrode.
However, current solid-state electrolytes are limited by low ionic
conductivity, inadequate electrode inter-facial compatibility, and
restricted electrochemical windows. This review discusses the status of
polymer-based electrolytes for Li-S batteries, and outlines current
methods for their fabrication, their transport characteristics and
ongoing research aimed at overcoming material properties hindering the
development of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.</p>

<p>At low temperatures, the physical properties of disordered solids are
dominated by two-level systems (TLS). We show that in disordered
superconductors, at sufficiently low frequencies <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, the coupling of TLS to external
ac electric fields increases dramatically in the presence of a dc
supercurrent. This giant enhancement manifests in all ac linear and
nonlinear phenomena. In particular, it leads to a parametric enhancement
of the real part of the ac conductivity and, consequently, of the
equilibrium current fluctuations. If the distribution of TLS relaxation
times is broad, the conductivity is inversely proportional to <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, and the spectrum of the
equilibrium current fluctuations takes the form of 1/f noise.</p>

<p>Granular materials in nature are nearly always non-spherical, but
particle shape effects in granular flow remain largely elusive. This
study uses discrete element method simulations to investigate how
elongated particle shapes affect the mobility of dense granular flows
down a rough incline. For a range of systematically varied particle
length-to-diameter aspect ratios (AR), we run simulations with various
flow thicknesses <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and slope angles
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to extract the well-known
<span class="math inline">\(h_\textrm{stop}(\theta)\)</span> curves
(below which the flow ceases) and the <span
class="math inline">\(Fr\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(h/h_\textrm{stop}\)</span> relations following
Pouliquen's approach, where <span
class="math inline">\(Fr=u/\sqrt{gh}\)</span> is the Froude number,
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the mean flow velocity, and
<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the gravitational
acceleration. The slope <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of
the <span class="math inline">\(Fr\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(h/h_\textrm{stop}\)</span> relations shows an
intriguing S-shaped dependence on AR, with two plateaus at small and
large AR, respectively, transitioning with a sharp increase. We
understand this S-shaped dependence by examining statistics of particle
orientation, alignment, and hindered rotation. We find that the rotation
ability of weakly elongated particles (<span
class="math inline">\(\textrm{AR}\lesssim1.3\)</span>) remains similar
to spheres, leading to the first plateau in the <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-AR relation, whereas the effects of
particle orientation saturates beyond <span
class="math inline">\(\textrm{AR}\approx2.0\)</span>, explaining the
second plateau. An empirical sigmoidal function is proposed to capture
this non-linear dependence. The findings are expected to enhance our
understanding of how particle shape affects the flow of granular
materials from both the flow- and particle-scale perspectives.</p>

<p>We report on chute measurements of the free-surface velocity <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in dense flows of spheres and diverse
sands and spheres-sand mixtures down rough inclines. These and previous
measurements are inconsistent with standard flow rules, in which the
Froude number <span class="math inline">\(v/\sqrt{gh}\)</span> scales
linearly with <span class="math inline">\(h/h_s\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\((\tan\theta/\mu_r)^2h/h_s\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_r\)</span> is the dynamic friction

and <span class="math inline">\(h_s(\theta)\)</span> its smallest value

characteristic length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> a flow
needs to fully develop can exceed the chute or travel length <span

<p>Altermagnets are a novel platform to realize exotic electromagnetic
properties distinct from those of conventional ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets. We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagnetic
nature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the band
structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single
crystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the
experimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show a
semi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for the
nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for the
antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a
negligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggest
the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting.
Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one near
the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively,
both of which are attributed to the topological surface states
associated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES results
suggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topological
surface/interface states need to be taken into account to properly
capture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.</p>

<p>Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route for
mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon
angular momentum without altering the material's structure or
composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile
switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic
ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with
giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to
spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic
field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can
be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical
temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching
2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic
model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations.
Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite
phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically
protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results
demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and
pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer
scale.</p>

<p>Randomness plays a key role in the order transition of active matter
but has not yet been explicitly considered in pairwise interaction
connection. In this letter, we introduce the perception rate P into the
Vicsek model as the probability of the interaction connections and model
the connections as superposition states. We show that with increasing P,
the polar order number undergoes an order transition and then
saturation. The order transition is a first-order phase transition with
band formation, and the effect of P is different from density. The
change of the order number is linked with the interaction structure. The
order transition, order saturation, and phase separation correspond to
different critical changes in the local interaction number. The global
interaction structure is further analyzed as a network. The decrease of
P is comparable to random edge removal, under which the network
experiences modal transitions near the critical points of the order
number, and the network exhibits surprising robustness. Our results
suggest that random interaction can be a new important factor in active
matter models, with potential applications in robotic swarms and social
activities.</p>

<p>MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to
their two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with various
functionalities similar to the existing graphene and transition metal
dichalcogenides. Aiming to open a new application field for MXenes in
the realm of electronic devices such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic
memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure
consisting of bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using
magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrate the field-free
current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the Hall-cross
configuration with the critical current density of ~30 MA/cm2. An
attempt to replace the Cr2N layer by the Pt layer leads to the absence
of field-free CIMS. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the
Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculation predicts the pronounced
orbital-Hall conductivity in the out-of-plane component, compared to the
spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N
layer at the interface, by contacting with Co in the [Co/Pt]3
ferromagnetic layer. The interfacial spin-filtering-like effect against
the out-of-plane polarized spin owing to the uncompensated magnetic
moment of Cr might be a possible cause for the field-free CIMS. These
results show a significant milestone in the advanced 2D-spintronics,
promising low-power and ultrahigh-integration.</p>

<p>Cohesion energy is an important property of liquid, and thus should
affect the saturation vapor pressure and the evaporation rate of the
liquids. Here, an analytical expression that relates the saturation

and the relationship of the evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplet
to the liquid cohesive energy was then obtained.</p>

<p>It is found from textbooks that there are the different versions of
the schematic diagram related to the Nernst equation, and consequently,
it leads to some discussion related to the Nernst equation and the
discovery of other meaningful schematic diagrams never appearing in
literature. It is also found that through the introduction of a new
function, the schematic diagram of the Nernst equation in the isothermal
process of any thermodynamic system can be generated in a unified way
and that the Nernst equation can be re-obtained from the experimental
data of low-temperature chemical reactions without any artificial
additional assumptions. The results obtained here show clearly that the
centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement is
completed.</p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, nanocarbons have become more significant as
nanostructured fillers in composites and, more recently, as functional
elements in a brand-new class of hybrid materials. Microwave-assisted
synthesis and processing is a burgeoning subject matter in materials
research with significant strides in the realm of nanocarbon during the
last decade. The review examines recent approaches to producing various
nanocarbons using microwaves as energy sources, the characterization of
such materials for various applications, and their results. The
underlying factors supporting the increased performance of such
materials or their composites are analyzed and reaction mechanisms are
presented wherever necessary. In particular, the recently developed and
verified approaches to produce porous carbon materials, CNTs and fibers,
carbon nanospheres, carbon dots, CQDs, reduced graphene oxide,
nanocarbon hybrid materials, and the purification and modification of
CNTs are discussed. The reduction of graphene oxide and the preparation
of graphene derivative hybrids using solid-state and liquid-state routes
such as polyopl, mixed solvents, ionic liquids, and microwave-assisted
hydrothermal/solvothermal methods are analyzed in detail. In addition,
the principles of microwave heating in liquid and solid states, the use
of metals particles as arcing agents or catalysts, and carbonaceous
materials as internal or external susceptors during synthesis and
modifications are presented in detail.</p>

<p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key
challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have
been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these
settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using
existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use
optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of
small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols
are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic
preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent
optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist
in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and
linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate
the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and
disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation
methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of
strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered
systems.</p>

<p>The Kondo effect is a hallmark of strongly-correlated systems, where
an impurity's local degrees of freedom are screened by conduction
electrons, forming a many-body singlet. With increasing degrees of
freedom in the impurity, theoretical studies face significant challenges
in accurately identifying and characterizing the underlying mechanisms
that screen the impurity. In this work, we introduce a straightforward
yet powerful methodology for identifying the formation of Kondo singlets
and their screening mechanisms, by utilizing the numerical
renormalization group (NRG) combined with the matrix product states
(MPS) technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the
single and two-level Anderson impurity models (AIM). Furthermore, we
discuss potential generalizations of the method to multichannel and
multiorbital Kondo impurities. Harnessing advanced tensor network
techniques, our approach extends to complex impurity systems, offering a
robust and versatile framework for studying Kondo physics.</p>

<p>We construct a general theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral
phonons under an adiabatic process, in which atoms rotate around their
equilibrium positions with a low phonon frequency. Here the spin
magnetization originates from the modulated electronic states with
spin-orbital coupling by atomic rotations. Under the adiabatic
approximation, the time-dependent spin magnetization can be calculated
by a Berry-phase method. In this paper, we focus on its time average,
which is evaluated by assuming that the phonon displacement is small. As
a result, the time average of the spin magnetization is concisely
formulated in the form of the Berry curvature defined in the
phonon-displacement space as an intrinsic property of atomic rotations.
Our formula for spin magnetization reflects the chiral nature of
phonons, and is convenient for <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span>

<p>Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles in metastable liquids, is
highly sensitive to nanoscale surface defects. Using molecular dynamics
simulations and classical nucleation theory, we show that pure water
confined within defect-free walls can withstand extreme negative
pressures, far beyond those observed experimentally. Hydrophobic
surfaces trigger heterogeneous cavitation and lower the cavitation
pressure magnitude, but not to experimental levels. Notably, a single
nanoscopic surface defect capable of hosting a vapor bubble drastically
reduces the tensile strength of water. We find that defects as small as
1-2 nm can act as effective cavitation nuclei, a scale smaller than
predicted by simple mechanical stability arguments. This discrepancy
arises from stochastic fluctuations of the vapor bubble, which can
overcome the kinetic free-energy barrier for cavitation. Our findings
show that cavitation is predominantly determined by the largest surface
defect rather than the overall defect density, emphasizing the
importance of eliminating the largest surface imperfections to enhance
stability against cavitation.</p>

<p>We investigate the behavior of {} in polygonal chambers and show that
the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get
dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time
before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe
the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the
boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell
model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping
behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the
boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion
and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is
shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time
scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with
the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the
trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster
escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular
diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking
behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or
contact seeking behavior is absent.</p>

<p>Metals have high electronic conductivities, but very low Seebeck
coefficients, which traditionally make them unsuitable for
thermoelectric materials. Recent studies, however, showed that metals
can deliver ultra-high thermoelectric power factors (PFs) under certain
conditions. In this work, we theoretically examine the electronic
structure and electronic transport specifications which allow for such
high PFs. Using Boltzmann transport (BTE) simulations and a multi-band
electronic structure model, we show that metals with: i) high degree of
transport asymmetry between their bands, ii) strong inter-band
scattering, and iii) a large degree of band overlap, can provide
ultra-high power factors. We show that each of these characteristics
adds to the steepness of the transport distribution function of the BTE,
which allows for an increase of the Seebeck coefficient to sizable
values, simultaneously with an increase in the electrical conductivity.
This work generalizes the concept that transport asymmetry (i.e.,
mixture of energy regions of high and low contributions to the
electrical conductivity), through a combination of different band
masses, scattering strengths, or energy filtering scenarios, etc., can
indeed result in very high thermoelectric power factors, even in the
absence of a material bandgap. Under certain conditions, transport
asymmetry can over-compensate any performance degradation to the PF due
to bipolar conduction and the naturally low Seebeck coefficients that
otherwise exist in this class of materials.</p>

<p>We investigate the impact of strain and adsorbed H adatoms on the
magnetic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a
combination of tight-binding and density functional theory methods for
both, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic edge configurations
(AFM). Our study reveals that longitudinal strain induces a significant
enhancement in the edge magnetic moment, that we attribute to
strain-driven modifications in the band structure. In addition, we
describe H~adatoms within the tight-binding approach by employing both
an unrelaxed vacancy model and the Anderson impurity model. By comparing
to density functional theory results, we corroborate that the Anderson
impurity model is best suited to describe H adsorption. We then focus on
the metallic FM edge configuration of the ZGNRs to better exploit the
tuning of its properties. We find that the magnetic configuration of
H~adatoms is strongly influenced by the edges, with an AFM coupling
between edges and the H~adatom. In fact, the magnetic spatial pattern of
the H adatom differs to that found in graphene due to this edge
coupling. Importantly, we find robust discrete plateaus of integer
magnetic moment as strain is varied in the defected ZGNRs, that we
relate to changes in the band structure, namely, a half-metallic
character or the opening of a gap. This behavior can be of interest for
magnetic applications of carbon-based nanostructures</p>

<p>Particle physics and radio-frequency (RF) superconductivity have
driven each other on since the 1970s. The unique properties of
superconductors (SC) have been the enabling keys for the realization of
accelerators with always increased performances thanks to the
realization of all-superconducting cavities. The use of increasingly
pure superconducting coatings for accelerating cavities, with lower and
lower RF losses, determined such high-quality factors that the need to
operate at low temperatures (below the superconducting transition
temperature Tc) was well paid for. Recently, with respect to the path
followed by the high frequency superconductivity, a new field opened
since SCs are being considered for GHz operation in high dc magnetic
fields, and measurements (and optimization) of totally different
quantities are needed. The possibility of successfully using SCs in high
magnetic fields for these purposes is far from obvious and it depends on
the outcome of accurate measurements of usually overlooked
quantities.</p>

<p>Granular materials are involved in most industrial and environmental
processes, as well as many civil engineering applications. Although
significant advances have been made in understanding the statics and
dynamics of cohesionless grains over the past decades, most granular
systems we encounter often display some adhesive forces between grains.
The presence of cohesion has effects at distances substantially larger
than the closest neighbors and consequently can greatly modify their
overall behavior. While considerable progress has been made in
understanding and describing cohesive granular systems through idealized
numerical simulations, controlled experiments corroborating and
expanding the wide range of behavior remain challenging to perform. In
recent years, various experimental approaches have been developed to
control inter-particle adhesion that now pave the way to further our
understanding of cohesive granular flows. This article reviews different
approaches for making particles sticky, controlling their relative
stickiness, and thereby studying their granular and bulk mechanics. Some
recent experimental studies relying on model cohesive grains are
synthesized, and opportunities and perspectives in this field are
discussed.</p>

<p>Ordered InAs quantum dot (QD) arrays have been obtained on
pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) substrates by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
local oxidation nanolithography. Prior to InAs molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) deposition, an ordered square array of nanoholes is formed at the
GaAs pre-patterned surface following in situ etching with atomic
hydrogen. A low substrate temperature is maintained during the whole
process in order to avoid pattern smoothing. Our results show that the
density and dimensions of the nanoholes on the GaAs surface determine
InAs QD size, nucleation site and InAs dose necessary for their
formation. As a function of the geometrical parameters of the nanohole
array, we can obtain either ordered 2D arrays of separated QD, closely
packed QD or localized areas for QD formation.</p>

<p>The significance of p-type transparent oxide semiconductors (TOS) in
the semiconductor industry is paramount, driving advancements in
optoelectronic technologies for transparent electronic devices with
unique properties. The recent discovery of p-type behavior in SeO2 has
stirred both interest and confusion in the scientific community. In this
Letter, we employ density functional theory calculations to unveil the
intrinsic insulating characteristics of SeO2, highlighting substantial
challenges in carrier doping. Our electronic structure analyses indicate
that the Se 5s2 states are energetically positioned too low to
effectively interact with the O 2p orbitals, resulting in a valence band
maximum (VBM) primarily dominated by the O 2p orbitals. The deep and
localized nature of the VBM in SeO2 limits its potential as a
high-mobility p-type TOS. Defect calculations demonstrate that all
intrinsic defects in SeO2 exhibit deep transition levels within the
bandgap. The Fermi level consistently resides in the mid-gap region,
regardless of synthesis conditions. Furthermore, deep intrinsic
acceptors and donors exhibit negative formation energies in the n-type
and p-type regions, respectively, facilitating their spontaneous
formation and impeding external doping efforts. Thus, the reported
p-type conductivity in SeO2 samples is unlikely intrinsic and is more
plausibly attributed to reduced elemental Se, a well-known p-type
semiconductor.</p>

<p>The in-plane-magnetic-field-induced Hall effect (IPHE) observed in
Weyl semimetals and PT-symmetric antiferromagnets has attracted
increasing attention, as it breaks the stereotype that the Hall effect
is induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field or magnetization. To date,
the IPHE has been discussed mainly for materials with low-symmetry
crystal/magnetic point groups. Here, we show that even if symmetry
forbids an inherent IPHE that arises from any mechanism, an apparent
IPHE can be generated by selecting a low-symmetry crystalline plane for
measurement. For rutile RuO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>,
although its high symmetry forbids an inherent IPHE, films grown along
the low-symmetry (1 1 1) and (1 0 1) orientations are found to exhibit a
distinct IPHE. The in-plane Hall coefficients are quantitatively
reproduced by referring to the out-of-plane Hall coefficients measured
for the high-symmetry (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) planes, indicating that the
observed IPHE is caused by a superposition of inequivalent out-of-plane
Hall effects. Similar behaviour is also observed for paramagnetic rutile
systems, indicating the ubiquity of the apparent IPHE in electronic and
spintronic devices with low-symmetry crystalline planes.</p>

<p>Amorphous solids are dynamically inhomogeneous due to in lack of
translational symmetry and hence exhibit vibrational properties
different from crystalline solids with anomalous low frequency
vibrational density of states (VDOS) and related low temperature thermal
properties. However, an interpretation of their origin from basic
physical laws is still needed compared with rapidly progressed particle
level investigations. In this work, we start with the quasi-equilibrium
condition, which requires elastic potential energy to be homogeneously
distributed even in an inhomogeneous elastic solid over long time
observation. Analytical result shows that the anomalous low frequency
VDOS behavior <span class="math inline">\(D(\omega) \propto
\omega^4\)</span> can be obtained when the quasi-equilibrium condition
is satisfied on an inhomogeneous elastic system. Under high frequency
after a crossover depending on the length scale of inhomogeneity, the
power law of VDOS is changed to square <span
class="math inline">\(D(\omega) \propto \omega^2\)</span> which is
Debye's law for crystalline solids. These features agree with recent
particle level investigations. Our work suggest that the universal low
frequency anomaly of amorphous solids can be considered as a result of
homogeneous thermalization.</p>

<p>Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with
superconductivity in intriguing ways. In this work, we propose that a
conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave magnet exhibits behaviors
analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal
dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity.
The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several
distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave magnetism than usual
ferromagnetism or <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave
altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the
low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition
occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic
field <span class="math inline">\(B_{c2}\)</span>; (iii) the
supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin
magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising
superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize
Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new
form of unconventional superconductivity generated by <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave magnetism.</p>

<p>We study the porous medium equation (PME) in one space dimension in
presence of additive non-conservative white noise, and interpreted as a
stochastic growth equation for the height field of an interface. We
predict the values of the two growth exponents <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> using the functional RG. Extensive
numerical simulations show agreement with the predicted values for these
exponents, however they also show anomalous scaling with an additional
"local" exponent <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\rm loc}\)</span>,
as well as multiscaling originating from broad distributions of local
height differences. The stationary measure of the stochastic PME is
found to be well described by a random walk model, related to a Bessel
process. This model allows for several predictions about the
multiscaling properties.</p>

<p>Embedding quantum dot circuits into microwave cavities has emerged as
a novel platform for controlling photon emission statistics by
electrical means. With such a model, we reveal previously undefined
quantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes by
breaking the photon gain-loss balance condition. For one-photon
interaction, the scaling theory indicates that the system undergoes a
continuous phase transition from thermal to coherent photon emissions,
consistent with conventional laser physics. Going beyond this, a hidden
discontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent
states in two-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a
mean-field theory, is predicted. Our prediction, along with its
extension to multiphoton processes, represents a key step towards
accessing lasing phase transitions.</p>

<p>Kagome superconductors AV<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Sb<span
class="math inline">\(_5\)</span> (A=K, Rb, Cs) have sparked
considerable interest due to the presence of several intertwined
symmetry-breaking phases within a single material. Recently, hysteresis
and reentrant superconductivity were observed experimentally through
magnetoresistance measurements in RbV<span
class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span>Sb<span
class="math inline">\(_{5}\)</span>, providing strong evidence of a
spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state. The
unconventional magnetic responses, combined with crystalline symmetry,
impose strong constraints on the possible pairing symmetries of the
superconducting state. In this work, we propose that RbV<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>Sb<span
class="math inline">\(_5\)</span> is an odd-parity superconductor
characterized by spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The hysteresis in
magnetoresistance and the reentrant superconductivity can both be
explained by the formation and evolution of superconducting domains
composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal properties of the
kagome superconductor RbV<span
class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span>Sb<span

by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected through

<p>Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated
using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built
using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency
Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional
theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the
Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of
the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased
the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate
weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of
the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the
experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.</p>

<p>A current challenge in atomistic machine learning is that of
efficiently predicting the response of the electron density under
electric fields. We address this challenge with symmetry-adapted kernel
functions that are specifically derived to account for the rotational
symmetry of a three-dimensional vector field. We demonstrate the
equivariance of the method on a set of rotated water molecules and show
its high efficiency with respect to number of training configurations
and features for liquid water and naphthalene crystals. We conclude
showcasing applications for relaxed configurations of gold
nanoparticles, reproducing the scaling law of the electronic
polarizability with size, up to systems with more than 2000 atoms. By
deriving a natural extension to equivariant learning models of the
electron density, our method provides an accurate and inexpensive
strategy to predict the electrostatic response of molecules and
materials.</p>

<p>In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the
negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of
low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems.
Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body
simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average
sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of
quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type
of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the
possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general
hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We
take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and
numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in
the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the
average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at
low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The
entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20%
doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The
vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the
Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states
with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the
correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight
into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly
correlated quantum many-body systems.</p>

<p>In this work, we report the study of electronic structure, magnetism,
and the existence of Weyl nodes in a pristine bulk FeNi<span

compounds, known as good metal catalysts with high activity and
stability for water splitting for a very long time. Our observation of
Weyl points in the bulk FeNi<span class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span>
may lead to a new technology to design highly efficient topological
catalysts. While the previous literature mainly focused on the thermal
and catalytic properties of FeNi<span
class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span> we report the interplay of Fe <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-Ni <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> hybridization and spin-orbit coupling
give rise to the ferromagnetic Weyl nodes in the bulk FeNi<span
class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span>. Our study shows that the ground
state of the bulk FeNi<span class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span> is a
Weyl metal with a large number of Weyl nodes at the Fermi energy away
from high-symmetry <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-points.
Furthermore, we predict a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of
about <span class="math inline">\(10000~S/m\)</span> at the ground
state. In addition, we show the existence of Weyl nodes along the high
symmetry <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-points <span
class="math inline">\(~0.2eV\)</span> above and <span
class="math inline">\(~0.05eV\)</span> below self-consistent Fermi level
that may be achieved either by the electron or hole doping, or by
external perturbation. In this article, FeNi<span
class="math inline">\(_{3}\)</span> has been studied to explore this
scenario using first-principles density functional theory and subsequent
Wannier90-based tight-binding method. Furthermore, we report the
existence of two types of Weyl cones, type-I and type-II, <span

provides a realistic material to further explore the intrinsic
properties related to Weyl cones, and the spintronic applications.</p>

<p>Any property of metallic glasses is controlled by the microscopic
ongoing relaxation processes. While the response of these processes to
temperature is well documented, little is known on their pressure
dependence, owning to non-trivial experimental challenges. By combining
fast differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and
high-pressure technologies, we identify the origin of a recently
discovered pressure-induced rejuvenation in metallic glasses from the
different pressure response of the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>- and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-relaxation in a series of
hydrostatically compressed Vit4 glasses. While the localized <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-relaxation promotes rejuvenation
and is associated to a constant looser atomic packing independent of the
applied pressure, the collective <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-relaxation triggers density driven
ordering processes promoting the stability. The latter parameter however
cannot be solely described by the degree of equilibration reached during
the compression, which instead determines the crossover between the two
regimes allowing to rescale the corresponding activation energies of the
two processes on a master curve.</p>

<p>Spintronics has emerged as a field of vast applicability, and layered
magnetic materials have served as a ground for advancement in this
direction. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed magnetic and
specific heat studies on NdSbSe, (a ZrSiS-based structure) magnetic
topological material. The temperature-dependent magnetization shows the
presence of competing magnetic interactions (<span
class="math inline">\(T_N&lt;T&lt;150\)</span> K) in addition to a
long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below 4.2~K. In the AFM
state, the isothermal magnetization confirms spin reorientation to the
critical magnetic field of 40 kOe. Frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility
measurements have probed the nonequilibrium dynamics of frustrated
magnetic moments (near 150 K). The <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-like peak at 3.8~K observed in
the specific heat shifts to a lower temperature with applied magnetic
fields and validates the AFM order. In addition, the specific heat does
not exhibit any sign corresponding to the short-range magnetic order
near 150 K (spin-glass-like memory effect). In addition, the derived
parameters from specific heat suggest the presence of a strong
electronic correlation in NdSbSe, resulting in a Kondo-like signature in
temperature-dependent resistivity data.</p>

<p>Inherent randomness and the resulting stochastic behavior of
fundamental particles manifested as quantum noise put a lower bound on
measurement imprecision in the quantum measurement process. In addition,
the quantum noise imparts decoherence and dephasing to the system being
measured, referred to as the measurement back-action. While the
microscopic effects of back-action have been observed, macroscopic
evidence is a rarity. Here we report a macroscopic display of the
back-action of an ultra-sensitive quantum point contact (QPC) electrical
amplifier whose transport is defined by the quantum tunneling of
electrons. The QPC amplifier, realized on GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures,
coupled to a planar superconducting resonator, operates at a frequency
of 2.155 GHz in the shot-noise-limited regime. The shot-noise excitation
of the mechanical modes and the resulting piezoelectric polarization
enhancing the shot-noise at the mode frequencies form a positive
feedback loop between the electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom.
While the excitation of the vibrational modes is a display of the
macroscopic effects of measurement back-action, the amplitudes of the
noise peaks allow us to calibrate the displacement sensitivity of the
QPC-resonator systems, which is in the order of 35 fm/SQRT(Hz) range,
making it an excellent sensor for ultra-sensitive and fast strain or
displacement detection.</p>

<p>Shallow undoped Si/SiGe quantum wells are the leading platforms for
hosting quantum processors based on spin-qubits. The ohmic contacts to
the electron gas in these systems are accomplished by ion-implantation
technique since the conventional Au/Sb alloyed contacts present a rough
surface consisting of sharp islands and pits. These sharp protrusions
cause electrical discharge across the gate-dielectric between the ohmic
contacts and the accumulation-gates causing device break-down. A clear
understanding of the surface morphology, elemental, compositional and
electrical characterization of the alloyed region would enable one to
engineer a smoother post alloyed surface. In this work, we find that the
rough surface morphology is a cumulative effect of the Au/Si eutectic
reaction and the threading dislocations inherent in the heterostructure.
The structural, elemental, and chemical-state analysis show that the
inverted pyramidal pits are resulting from the enhanced Au/Si eutectic
reaction at the threading dislocations stemming from the heterostructure
interface, while, the sharp protrusions causing accumulation
gate-leakage are gold-rich precipitations. The protrusions are removed
using an aqua regia treatment prior to the deposition of the gate-oxide
and gate electrode. Exploiting a Hall bar device, we analyse the
mobility and carrier concentration of the undoped Si/SiGe consisting of
Au/Sb alloyed contacts down to 1.5 K. The measured mobility ~10^5
cm^2/Vs and carrier concentration of ~10<sup>11/cm</sup>2are comparable
to the reported values on similar high-mobility heterostructures
confirming the efficacy of our modified Au/Sb alloy technique in
accomplishing high-efficiency contacts to undoped Si/SiGe
heterostructures.</p>

<p>Properties of twist grain boundaries (TGB), long known structurally
but not tribologically, are simulated under sliding and load, with
Au(111) our test case. The load-free TGB moiré is smooth and superlubric
at incommensurate twists. Strikingly, load provokes a first-order
structural transformation, where the highest energy moiré nodes are
removed -- an Aubry-type transition for which we provide a Landau theory
and a twist-load phase diagram. Upon frictional sliding, the
transformation causes a superlubric-locked transition, with a huge
friction jump, and irreversible plastic flow. The predicted phenomena
are robust, also recovered in a Lennard-Jones lattice TGB, and not
exclusive to gold or to metals.</p>

<p>Many decades of study have revealed very unusual properties of the
helical phase transition in MnSi. This situation is briefly described
and illustrated in the present note. As one will be able to see, one
peculiarity is that the phase transition point in MnSi is accompanied by
extremes of different thermodynamic and kinetic quantities on the high
temperature side of the transition, which look similar to a property of
2D systems. The whole situation can be tentatively described as a phase
transformation of the helical phase of MnSi to the paramagnetic state,
which occurs in two steps, first as a first order phase transition and
then following a breakdown of topological objects such as spin
vortices.</p>

<p>Strontium titanate (STO) possesses promising properties for
applications in thermoelectricity, catalysis, fuel cells, and more, but
its performance is highly dependent on stoichiometry and impurity
levels. While atom probe tomography (APT) can provide detailed
three-dimensional atomic-scale chemical information, STO specimens have
been challenging to analyze due to premature specimen fracture. In this
study, we show that by applying a thin metal coating to atom probe tips,
STO specimens can be analyzed with nearly 100% success. Using this
approach, we investigate both undoped STO and 1 at% Nb-doped STO,
achieving sufficient sensitivity to detect Nb concentrations as low as
0.7 at%. This work establishes a reliable APT method for high-resolution
chemical analysis of STO at the nanoscale.</p>

<p>Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing
the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we
report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative
substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic
simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our
findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial
sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An
intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also
observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce
unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting,
due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these
observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify
the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This
approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce
distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic
simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method
enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies,
significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system.
Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic
positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial
segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB
interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute
behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation
alloys.</p>

<p>Advanced defect engineering techniques have enabled the creation of
unique quantum phases from pristine materials. One-dimensional (1D)
atomic defects in low-dimensional systems are particularly intriguing
due to their distinct quantum properties, such as 1D Rashba states that
allow for the generation of nondissipative spin currents, making them
ideal for spintronic devices. Using density-functional calculations and
model-based symmetry analysis, we report the emergence of 1D Rashba
states in a two-dimensional Si<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span>Bi<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span> monolayer (ML) with vacancy line
defects (VLDs). We show that introducing VLDs in the Si<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span>Bi<span
class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span> ML induces 1D confined defect states
near the Fermi level, which are strongly localized along the extended
defect line. Notably, we observed 1D Rashba spin-split bands in these
defect states with significant spin splitting originating mainly from
the strong <span class="math inline">\(p-p\)</span> coupling orbitals
between Si and Bi atoms near the defect sites. These spin-split defect
states exhibit perfectly collinear spin polarization in momentum <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{k}\)</span>-space, which is oriented
perpendicularly to the VLD orientation. Moreover, using <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}\)</span> perturbation theory
supplemented with symmetry analysis, we show that the 1D Rashba states
with collinear spin polarization are enforced by the lowering of
symmetry of the VLDs into the <span class="math inline">\(C_{s}\)</span>
point group, which retains the <span
class="math inline">\(M_{xz}\)</span> mirror symmetry along with the 1D
nature of the VLDs. The observed 1D Rashba states in this system protect
carriers against spin decoherence and support an exceptionally long spin
lifetime, which could be promising for developing highly efficient
spintronic devices.</p>

<p>Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological
degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of
Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the
opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable
spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known
to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with
respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored
territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite
temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos
series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the
level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large
system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the
temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the
Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends
exponentially on the inverse temperature <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, and on an effective energy scale

<p>Revealing statistics of H-defect interactions provides insights into
significant ductility loss due to the particular strain partitioning in
H-charged structural alloys. Experimental investigation of these
interactions is extremely difficult, labor-intensive, and costly. Here,
we used MD and GCMC simulations and studied H-diffusion deformation at
polycrystalline scale with atomic resolution efficiently. To study
H-free surface interactions, large pillars including all possible angles
and planes of free surfaces were modeled. To study H-grain boundary
interactions, several polycrystalline models containing comparable
statistics of low and high angle grain boundaries were examined. We
studied the statistics of H-segregation tendencies based on free surface
angles and grain boundary types. Dislocation activities were also
classified for these various types and total density and strength were
compared and analyzed compared to H-free samples. In the free surface
model, it was observed that H was evenly distributed along the model's
surface. Although the dislocation density was reduced compared to H-free
samples, localized bands of dislocations were produced. Additionally in
the polycrystalline samples, it was concluded that H tends to segregate
along grain boundaries with misorientation angles less than or equal to
25 degrees. However, specific misorientation angle interactions --
namely <span class="math inline">\(&gt;45\)</span> degrees -- led to
increased dislocation density in H-charged samples compared to their
H-free counterparts.</p>

<p>We investigate the universality of an Ising symmetry breaking phase
transition of tilted two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in the type-I phase
as well as at the Lifshitz transition between a type-I and a type-II
semimetal, where the Fermi surface changes from point-like to one with
electron and hole pockets that touch at the overtilted Dirac cones. We
compute the Landau damping of long-wavelength order parameter
fluctuations by tilted Dirac fermions and use the resulting IR
propagator as input for a renormalisation-group analysis of the
resulting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. We first demonstrate that the
criticality of tilted type-I fermions is controlled by a line of fixed
points along which the poles of the renormalised Green function
correspond to an untilted Dirac spectrum with varying anisotropy of
Fermi velocities. At the phase transition the Lorentz invariance is
restored, resulting in the same critical exponents as for conventional
Dirac systems. The multicritical point is given by the endpoint of the
fixed-point line. It can be approached along any path in parameter space
that avoids the fixed point line of the critical type-I semimetal. We
show that the critical exponents at the Lifshitz point are different and
that Lorentz invariance is broken.</p>

Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and the Topological Magneto-electric
Effect can be realized. Here, we focus on the rather unexplored issue of
how surface reconstructions, which are likely to occur in experiments,
influence these properties. Using first-principles calculations together
with molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine learning
force field, we demonstrate that interstitial-2H and peripheral-2H type
atomic reconstructions are responsible for modifying the exchange gap
and surface characteristics of MBT thin films, with important
implications for the topological indices and the nature of quasi
one-dimensional side-wall edge states dominating quantum transport. in
Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our
analysis provides a theoretical framework to elucidate the nature and
effect of reconstructions in MBT thin films, with predictions for the

<p>Mechanical interactions among cells in a growing microbial colony can
significantly influence the colony's spatial genetic structure and,
thus, evolutionary outcomes such as the fates of rare mutations. Here,
we computationally investigate how this spatial genetic structure
changes as a result of heritable phenotypic variations in cell shape. By
modeling rod-like bacterial cells as lengthening and dividing
circo-rectangles in a 2D Brownian dynamics framework, we simulate the
growth of a colony containing two populations with different aspect
ratios. Compared to monodisperse colonies, such bidisperse colonies
exhibit diminished intermixing between sub-populations when the less
elongated cells are too short to nematically order, instead forming
large clusters. We find that the cells with longer aspect ratio
gradually segregate to the colony periphery. We present evidence that
this demixing is related to nematic order in the bulk and to active
nematic mixing dynamics near the periphery. These findings are
qualitatively robust across different growth rate protocols and initial
conditions. Because the periphery is often an advantageous position when
nutrients are limited, our results suggest a possible evolutionary
selective pressure of mechanical origin that favors large cell aspect
ratio.</p>

<p>We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band
systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on
an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from
the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions
are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit
vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian
model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the
phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish
between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and
edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions
from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions
are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.</p>

<p>Interatomic potentials are essential for driving molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, directly impacting the reliability of predictions
regarding the physical and chemical properties of materials. In recent
years, machine-learned potentials (MLPs), trained against
first-principles calculations, have become a new paradigm in materials
modeling as they provide a desirable balance between accuracy and
computational cost. The neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach,
implemented in the open-source GPUMD software, has emerged as a
promising machine-learned potential, exhibiting impressive accuracy and
exceptional computational efficiency. This review provides a
comprehensive discussion on the methodological and practical aspects of
the NEP approach, along with a detailed comparison with other
representative state-of-the-art MLP approaches in terms of training
accuracy, property prediction, and computational efficiency. We also
demonstrate the application of the NEP approach to perform accurate and
efficient MD simulations, addressing complex challenges that traditional
force fields typically can not tackle. Key examples include structural
properties of liquid and amorphous materials, chemical order in complex
alloy systems, phase transitions, surface reconstruction, material
growth, primary radiation damage, fracture in two-dimensional materials,
nanoscale tribology, and mechanical behavior of compositionally complex
alloys under various mechanical loadings. This review concludes with a
summary and perspectives on future extensions to further advance this
rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p>The control of ferroelectric domain walls and their dynamics on the
nanoscale becomes increasingly important for advanced nanoelectronics
and novel computing schemes. One common approach to tackle this
challenge is the pinning of walls by point defects. The fundamental
understanding on how different defects influence the wall dynamics is,
however, incomplete. In particular, the important class of defect
dipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently underrepresented
in theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular dynamics
simulations based on an -derived effective Hamiltonian and methods from
materials informatics, and analyze the impact of these defects on the
motion of 180<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> domain walls
in tetragonal BaTiO<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>. We show how
these defects can act as local pinning centers and restoring forces on
the domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can flow around
sparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and how
pinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defect
distribution. Surprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants and
walls is short-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for the
nucleation processes underlying wall motion is the defect-free area in
front of the wall.</p>

<p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a hallmark of time-reversal symmetry
breaking, has been reported in rutile RuO2, a debated metallic
altermagnetic candidate. Previously, AHE in RuO2 was observed only in
strain-relaxed thick films under extremely high magnetic fields (~50 T).
Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic
structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects
suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we
demonstrate that ultrathin, fully-strained 2 nm TiO2/t nm RuO2/TiO2
(110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain
metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic
field (&lt; 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that
epitaxial strain stabilizes a non-compensated magnetic ground state and
reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO2 (110) thin films. These findings
establish ultrathin RuO2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism
and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in
advancing spintronic technologies.</p>

<p>Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are often corrupted by
noise, hindering their interpretation. To address this issue, we propose
a deep learning-based approach using simulated images. Using density
functional theory calculations with a set of pseudo-atomic orbital basis
sets, we generate highly accurate ground truth images. We introduce four
types of noise into these simulations to create realistic training
datasets. Each type of noise is then used to train a separate
convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our results show that these
CNNs are effective in reducing noise, even when applied to images with
different noise levels than those used during training. However, we
observe limitations in some cases, particularly in preserving the
integrity of circular shapes and avoiding visible artifacts between
image patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose alternative
training strategies and future research directions. This study provides
a valuable framework for training deep learning models for TEM image
denoising.</p>

<p>Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic
properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other
low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g.,
nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to
strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However,
these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational
challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles
calculations, we show that mono-layer <span
class="math inline">\(P_2C_3\)</span> -- identified in a previous letter
to possess
<code>double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to</code>brick-wall'',
and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in <span
class="math inline">\(P_2C_3\)</span>NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting
induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also
discussed.</p>

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials with multifunctional properties, such
as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), magnetism, catalysis, and energy
storage capabilities, are of significant interest for advanced
applications in flexible electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and
lithium-ion batteries. However, the discovery of such materials,
particularly in low-dimensional forms, remains a challenge. In this
study, we perform high-throughput density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations to explore a new class of 2D V-shaped monolayers with
remarkable physicochemical properties. Among 18 stable <span
class="math inline">\(M_4X_8\)</span> (M = transition metal; X =
halogen) compounds, we identify 9 auxetic monolayers, with standing out
for its exceptionally high NPR of -0.798. Notably, 4 of these materials
exhibit half semiconductor properties, while 5 others are bipolar
magnetic semiconductors, offering a unique combination of electronic and
magnetic behavior. Additionally, these materials demonstrate promising
catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER)
and show potential as anodes for rechargeable metal-ion batteries,
particularly in alkali-ion systems. This work not only expands the
family of 2D NPR materials but also introduces new candidates with
multifunctional capabilities for a wide range of applications in
nanoelectronics, catalysis, and energy storage.</p>

<p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La<span

has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible
density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome.
Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin
of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of

observed below <span class="math inline">\(T_{\rm DW}\)</span>,
accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate,
indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state.

<p>Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in
amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in
superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they
absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency
range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this
absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent
dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the
theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics.
It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS
dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to
the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative
explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are distributed according to the
specific power law <span class="math inline">\(P(p) \propto
1/p^{3-\eta}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0\leq \eta
&lt;1\)</span>). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss
tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is
supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole
moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range
dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with
the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of
TLSs.</p>

<p>Kitaev spin liquid (KSL), consisting of the bond direction-dependent
spin interactions in the honeycomb lattice, attracts huge attention
because of its exact solvability and prospect for applications to
quantum computing. An important feature of KSL is the half-quantized
thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under the magnetic field perpendicular
to the lattice, but HQTHC stands only at low temperatures. Here, in the
temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically propose the
extrinsic phonon contribution to thermal Hall Effect in KSL via the
skew-scattering of chiral phonons by the scalar spin chirality, which
was previously studied in Mott insulators. We show the emergence of the
scalar spin chirality of fluctuating spins, estimate the emergent field
strength and its symmetric form applied to the chiral phonons, and
obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity, which is
semi-quantitatively consistent with the existing experiments. This work
provides a basic understanding of the role of spin-phonon interactions
in strongly correlated systems.</p>

<p>Construction of transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials
with a minimal number of parameters is important for their general
applicability. Here, we present a machine-learning interatomic potential
with the functional form of the bond-order potential for comprehensive
exploration over the configuration space of carbon. The physics-based
design of this potential enables robust and accurate description over a
wide range of the potential energy surface with a small number of
parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of this potential through
validations across various tasks, including phonon dispersion
calculations, global structure searches for clusters, phase diagram
calculations, and enthalpy-volume mappings of local minima structures.
We expect that this potential can contribute to the discovery of novel
carbon materials.</p>

<p>Van der Waals (vW) Josephson junctions (JJs) realized by stacking
materials such as few-layered NbSe2, offers a new landscape to realize
superconducting quantum devices with superior properties owing to its
crystalline nature and defect-free junctions. For quantum technology,
overdamped JJs are highly sought-after, whose realization demands
precise control of junction capacitance by engineering the junction area
using microfabrication techniques. NbSe2 is highly reactive and
susceptible to damage during microfabrication processes. In this
manuscript, we demonstrate both underdamped and overdamped NbSe2-NbSe2
JJs by controlling the junction area. We devise a minimally invasive
microfabrication procedure, post-junction formation, to precisely
control the junction area. The McCumber parameter characterizing the
damping is extracted from the electrical transport measurements down to
130 mK. The results show that our sample fabrication recipe has
preserved the material qualities and paved the way for the realization
of scalable JJ devices on NbSe2 and similar systems.</p>

<p>Thermodynamic constraints impose a trade-off between power and
efficiency in heat engines, preventing the simultaneous achievement of
high power and high efficiency. For classical microscopic engines,
explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherent
inevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions of
these results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases of
slow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-off
relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finite
time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. By
utilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probability
representations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicable
to arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes.
Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the
efficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is
stricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions
under which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power is
achieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and the
difference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. These
findings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirm
their applicability across various types of protocols for heat engine
cycles.</p>

<p>We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in
complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the
density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints:
one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to
the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible
for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method
is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important
role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the
aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The
symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three
parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry
of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio
calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in
the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon
excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the
electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have
identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the
altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te
atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and
calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The
knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to
accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as
a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection
between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and
the chirality properties of these states we investigate the

<p>In many biological systems localized mechanical information is
transmitted by mechanically neutral chemical signals. Typical examples
include contraction waves in acto-myosin cortex at cellular scale and
peristaltic waves at tissue level. In such systems, chemical activity is
transformed into mechanical deformation by distributed motor-type
mechanisms represented by continuum degrees of freedom. To elucidate the
underlying principles of chemo-mechanical coupling, we present in this
Letter the simplest example. It involves directional motion of a
localized solitary wave in a distributed mechanical system guided by a
purely chemical cue. Our main result is that mechanical signals can be
driven by chemical activity in a highly efficient manner.</p>

<p>We demonstrate a simple magnetic field stabilization technique in a
Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Our technique is based on the
precise measurement of the current fluctuations in the main magnetic
field coils and amounts to their compensation using an auxiliary coil.
It has the advantage of simplicity as compensation is done using a low
inductance coil that can be straightforwardly driven at the relevant
frequencies (1 kHz). The performances of the different components (power
supply, current transducer, electronics...) are precisely characterized.
In addition, for optimal stability the ambient magnetic field is also
measured and compensated. The magnetic field stability around 57 G is
measured by Ramsey spectroscopy of magnetic field sensitive
radiofrequency transition between two spin states of potassium 39 and
the shot-to-shot fluctuations are reduced to 64(7) <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>G rms, i.e. at the 1 x 10 -6 level. In
the context of our experiment, this result opens interesting prospects
for the study of three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensate
potassium spin mixtures.</p>

<p>In the study of quantum spin liquids, the Kitaev model plays a
pivotal role due to the fact that its ground state is exactly known as
well as the fact that it may be realized in strongly frustrated
materials such as <span
class="math inline">\({\alpha}\)</span>-RuCl<span
class="math inline">\({}_3\)</span>. While topological insulators and
superconductors can be investigated by means of topological band theory
-- in particular the topological quantum chemistry (TQC) formalism --
the Kitaev model evades such a treatment, as it is not possible to set
up a proper single-particle Green's function for it. We instead
associate spin operators with ``orbitals'' that give rise to a band
structure. It is thereby possible to analyze the corresponding
excitation spectrum engendered by these localized excitations by means
of TQC. Special attention is given to the low-energy topological edge
mode spectrum. Our work sheds light on the question how the TQC
formalism may be generalized to strongly correlated and topologically
ordered systems like the Kitaev model.</p>

<p>We report on the study of itinerant magnetism of lattice-trapped
magnetic atoms, driven by magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, in the
low-entropy and close-to-unit filling regime. We have used advanced
dynamical decoupling techniques to efficiently suppress the sensitivity
to magnetic field fluctuations. We have thus measured the spin coherence
of an itinerant spin 3 Bose dipolar gas throughout a quantum phase
transition from a superfluid phase to a Mott insulating phase. In the
superfluid phase, a metastable ferromagnetic behavior is observed below
a dynamical instability which occurs at lattice depths below the phase
transition. In the insulating phase, the thermalization towards a
paramagnetic state is driven by an interplay between intersite and
superexchange interactions.</p>

<p>Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of
self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal
scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface
kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified
depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is
columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of
natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else
time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic
scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific
universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine
function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is
that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of
randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all
the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated
with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces.
Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture,
however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling
preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry
are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry
arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of
randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings)
affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by
numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and
columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence
confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets
apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the
absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</p>

<p>We report on the stability of the magnetic dipole string (DS), a
three-dimensional magnetic texture formed by two coupled Bloch points
with opposite topological charges, separated by an equilibrium distance.
Previous studies demonstrated the stability of such configurations
through geometric confinement or coupling with local perturbations in
the magnetization field, such as skyrmion strings or dislocations in
helical modulations. Here, we show that, in uniaxial chiral magnets, an
isolated DS remains stable in an unperturbed vacuum, thus representing a
true three-dimensional soliton. The phase diagram illustrates the
stability of the DS embedded in the conical or helical phases across a
broad range of material parameters and external magnetic fields. Using
the geodesic nudged elastic band method applied to a regularized
micromagnetic model, we demonstrate that isolated DSs are protected from
collapse by an energy barrier. Stochastic spin-lattice simulations
demonstrate that DSs can spontaneously nucleate during in-field
annealing. This work aims to stimulate the experimental observation of
DSs and further exploration of uniaxial chiral magnets.</p>

<p>In ABP systems, phase separation is accompanied by the emergence of
vapor bubbles within liquid domains. Using large-scale particle-based
simulations, we study the stochastic dynamics of these bubbles and find
that most nucleate, grow, and dissolve within liquid domains. We show
that their area dynamics can be described by a Langevin equation with a
constant negative drift and noise proportional to the perimeter, fully
characterizing bubble area and lifetime statistics. Additionally, we
develop a lattice gas model that captures the morphological properties,
including the decrease in bubble asphericity with increasing area. These
findings provide new insights into phase separation in active matter and
highlight limitations in current continuum theories.</p>

<p>Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large
area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that
rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the
area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a
sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g.,
via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual
native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via
laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown
large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for
growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed
for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we
identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds
of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We
quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the
overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction
in the diamond layer above the holes.</p>

<p>A thin cobalt layer is deposited by electron beam evaporation onto a
germanium substrate after an in situ cleaning annealing at 400 or 700 C.
The effect of these pretreatments on the Co/Ge Schottky barrier
properties and on the germanide formation is investigated by using
different techniques. A strong influence of the pre-treatment is
observed. The pre-treatment at 700 C removes the native oxide but
enhances the diffusion of contaminants. After post-metal deposition
annealing, the sample pre-treated at 700 C shows a double layer
structure due to interdiffusion, whereas some large isolated islands are
present in the sample pre-treated at 400 C.</p>

<p>X-ray scattering has been an indispensable tool in advancing our
understanding of matter, from the first evidence of the crystal lattice
to recent discoveries of nuclei's fastest dynamics. In addition to the
lattice, ultrafast resonant elastic scattering of soft X-rays provides a
sensitive probe of charge, spin, and orbital order with unparalleled
nanometre spatial and femto- to picosecond temporal resolution. However,
the full potential of this technique remains largely unexploited due to
its high demand on the X-ray source. Only a selected number of
instruments at large-scale facilities can deliver the required
short-pulsed and wavelength-tunable radiation, rendering
laboratory-scale experiments elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate
time-resolved X-ray scattering with spectroscopic contrast at a
laboratory-based instrument using the soft-X-ray radiation emitted from
a laser-driven plasma source. Specifically, we investigate the
photo-induced response of magnetic domains emerging in a ferrimagnetic
heterostructure with 9<span class="math inline">\(\,\)</span>ps temporal
resolution. The achieved sensitivity allows for tracking the
reorganisation of the domain network on pico- to nanosecond time scales
in great detail. This instrumental development and experimental
demonstration break new ground for studying material dynamics in a wide
range of laterally ordered systems in a flexible laboratory
environment.</p>

<p>We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau
levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to
non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of
a holomorphic curve -- an ideal Kähler band -- and its associated
unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic
maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they
are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the
static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled
GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau
levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of
Landau levels.</p>

<p>Numerous aqueous systems host elements in multiple redox states, with
wide ranging implications such as their influence on the
formation/dissolution of minerals, water toxicity, and nutrient cycling.
To uncover governing mechanisms and complex chemical interactions in
aqueous systems, reactive-transport models have increasingly gained
importance. However, their predictive capabilities remain limited
because existing approaches struggle to accurately account for the full
complexities of redox reactions. Here, we develop a reactive-transport
framework that leverages recent advancements in thermodynamic modelling,
speciation chemistry, and redox kinetics. Distinct from traditional
models, we uniquely treat redox kinetics along with transport as
transient phenomena, decoupled from Gibbs free energy minimisation.
Ensuring ion concentrations are governed by non-equilibrium rate laws,
this approach allows predicting the tempo-spatial distribution of
speciation and precipitation of species across oxidation states. We
illustrate the versatility of our framework through two case studies:
manganese speciation in natural waters and the fate of dissolved iron in
aqueous/porous media. Our framework significantly enhances the modelling
of a diverse range of redox-sensitive environments.</p>

<p>We develop a Green's function approach for the nonequilibrium
dynamics of multi-level quantum dots coupled to multiple fermionic
reservoirs in the presence of a bosonic environment. Our theory is
simpler than the Keldysh approach and goes beyond scattering state
constructions. In concrete terms, we study Josephson junctions
containing a quantum dot and coupled to an electromagnetic environment.
In the dot region, spin-orbit interactions, a Zeeman field, and in
principle also Coulomb interactions can be included. We then study
quantum Mpemba effects, assuming that the average phase difference
across the Josephson junction is subject to a rapid quench. For a short
singlechannel junction, we show that both types of quantum Mpemba
effects allowed in open quantum systems are possible. We also study an
intermediate-length junction, where spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman
field are included. Again quantum Mpemba effects are predicted.</p>

<p>This article concludes a three-part series developing a
self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid
membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid
membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However,
this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical
behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this,
we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive
effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid
membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and
the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory
as <span class="math inline">\((2+\delta)\)</span>-dimensional, where
<span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> indicates the membrane
thickness. However, the <span
class="math inline">\((2+\delta)\)</span>-dimensional balance laws
derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required
to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise
appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the
in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The
viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid
model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional
models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a
free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to
the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in
its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory.
Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid
membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface
incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally,
we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of
motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.</p>

<p>Terahertz scanning near-field optical microscope (THz-SNOM) is
employed to measure ultrafast evolution of THz conductivity spectra
after photoexcitation of GaAs and InP wafers using ultrashort laser
pulses. Unlike in GaAs, the THz photoconductivity decay in InP is
controlled mainly by the diffusion of electrons away from the
photoexcited area, and also by the drift due to band-bending at the
surface of the semiconductor. We propose and discuss several general
strategies of the analysis of signals measured using THz-SNOM, and we
estimate the accuracy of the obtained near-field photoconductivity
spectra.</p>

<p>We study the relaxation time of a plasma which is perturbed by means
of a time-dependent pulsed force. This time pulse is modelled using a
Gaussian superposition. During such a pulse two forces are considered:
An inhomogeneous oscillating electric force and the corresponding
ponderomotive force. The evolution of such an ensemble is driven by the
Boltzmann Equation, and the perturbed population is described by a
power-law distribution function. In this work, as a new feature, instead
the usual techniques the transient between both distributions is
analysed using the Central Limit Theorem. This technique, together with
the ad hoc solved equation of motion of the charges under this
particular system of pulsed forces, allows to find the corresponding
expressions relating the time pulse with the relaxation times and the
dynamic conditions. Furthermore, numerical estimates are also presented.
As a result, we show a persistence effect of excitation at high
frequencies, when the initial excitation pulse has already ended. The
concatenation of such successive pulses could be of interest, for
example, in experimental applications with pulsed lasers.</p>

<p>Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges
superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating
observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three
steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link.
First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly
sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that
higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in
larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can
be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy
to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated
by shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale
disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin
stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate
voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing
rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported,
suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not
linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are
transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as
germanium and carbon.</p>

<p>Half-Heuslers are a promising family for thermoelectric (TE)
applications, yet only a small fraction of their potential chemistries
has been experimentally explored. In this work, we introduce a distinct
computational high-throughput screening approach designed to identify
underexplored yet promising material subspaces, and apply it to
half-Heusler thermoelectrics. We analyze 1,126 half-Heuslers satisfying

<p>Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) host topologically protected
edge states, but the role that these edge states play in electronic
transport remains unclear. Using scanning superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID) microscopy, we performed local measurements
of the current distribution in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator
at large bias currents, where the quantization of the conductivity
tensor breaks down. We find that bulk currents in the channel interior
coexist with edge currents at the sample boundary. While the position of
the edge current changes with the reversal of the magnetic field, it
does not depend on the current direction. To understand our
observations, we introduce a model which includes contributions from
both the sample magnetization and currents driven by chemical potential
gradients. To parameterize our model, we use local measurements of the
chemical potential induced changes in the sample magnetization. Our
model reveals that the observed edge currents can be understood as
changes in the magnetization generated by the electrochemical potential
distribution in the sample under bias. Our work underscores the
complexity of electronic transport in MTIs and highlights both the value
and challenges of using magnetic imaging to disentangle various
contributions to the electronic transport signatures.</p>

<p>Quantum confining excitons has been a persistent challenge in the
pursuit of strong exciton interactions and quantum light generation.
Unlike electrons, which can be readily controlled via electric fields,
imposing strong nanoscale potentials on excitons to enable quantum
confinement has proven challenging. In this study, we utilize
piezoresponse force microscopy to image the domain structures of twisted
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), revealing evidence of strong in-plane
electric fields at the domain boundaries. By placing a monolayer MoSe2
only one to two nanometers away from the twisted hBN interface, we
observe energy splitting of neutral excitons and Fermi polarons by
several millielectronvolts at the moiré domain boundaries. By directly
correlating local structural and optical properties, we attribute such
observations to excitons confined in a nanoscale one-dimensional
electrostatic potential created by the strong in-plane electric fields
at the moiré domain boundaries. Intriguingly, this 1D quantum
confinement results in pronounced polarization anisotropy in the
excitons' reflection and emission, persistent to temperatures as high as
~80 Kelvins. These findings open new avenues for exploring and
controlling strongly interacting excitons for classical and quantum
optoelectronics.</p>

<p>Materials exhibiting a martensitic phase transition are essential for
applications in shape memory alloys, actuators and sensors.
Hexamethylbenzene (HMB) has long been considered as a classical example
of ferroelastic organic crystals since Mnyukh's pioneering work in
1970s. However, the atomistic mechanism underlying this phase transition
has never been clarified. In this work, we present a direct molecular
dynamics simulation to investigate the phase transition mechanism in
HMB. For the first time, we report a simulation results that can
accurately reproduce both the transition temperature and hysteresis loop
observed in previous experimental studies. By analyzing the MD
trajectories, the potential energy surface, we identified that a
low-barrier atomic sliding mode along the close-packed (11<span
class="math inline">\(\overline{1}\)</span>) plane of the
low-temperature phase is the key to trigger the phase transition at the
critical temperature window. This is further confirmed by the observed
continuous softening of shear modulus around the transition window. Our
results demonstrate that the integration of various atomistic modeling
techniques can provide invaluable insight into the martensitic phase
transition mechanisms in organic crystals and guide the development of
new organic martensites.</p>

<p>Insects like dragonflies and cicadas possess nanoprotusions on their
wings that rupture bacterial membranes upon contact, inspiring synthetic
antibacterial surfaces mimicking this phenomenon. Designing such
biomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interaction
between nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scales
of these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulations
offer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This study
presents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanical
responses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes to
nanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical and
cylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, we
identified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity,
typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillar
tips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity,
characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing at
contact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring a
threefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillar
height and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greater
heights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increased
spacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model,
representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enables
cost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods. Our
findings provide essential insights for optimizing nanopillared surface
designs, advancing antibacterial technology through tailored height and
spacing configurations.</p>

<p>To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various
toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable,
especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase
transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired
brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has,
however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a
single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational
methodology for the design of a material that combines these two
toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that
captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture
performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite
with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline
mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase
transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations,
and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation
stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar
constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the
two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely
effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick
size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is
then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization
algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material
parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar
thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of
material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar
thicknesses.</p>

diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet
hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms
of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this
effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials,
relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for
both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of
100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch
between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents
across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish
functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.</p>

<p>In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted
significant attention due to their association with extraordinary
transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes
phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner
crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems,
two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can
host electronic states with unique band structures, such as
dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this
work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class
of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the
effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The
studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic
framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite
square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures.
In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into
quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By
tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence
of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably,
all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating,
semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the
potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating
electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</p>

<p>Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly
integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance
(ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that
span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits,
environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of
studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being
that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned,
precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with
expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering
NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate
superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with
simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating
densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment
for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in
microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of
deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic
dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel
accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in
micromagnetometry.</p>

<p>Advances in research have sparked an increasing curiosity in
understanding the plasmonic excitation properties of molecular-scale
systems. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the fundamental building
blocks of graphene, have been documented to possess plasmonic properties
through experimental observations, making them prime candidates for
investigation. By doping different elements, the conjugated structure of
the molecule can be altered. In this study, the plasmonic excitation
properties influenced by conjugated structures in peropyrene and its
derivatives are investigated through first-principles calculations that
combine the plasmonicity index, generalized plasmonicity index and
transition contribution maps. For molecular plasmonic excitation, the
conjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of valence
electrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancement
characteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degree
of alteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elements
will result in varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiating
different trends in the evolution of plasmonic resonance. This further
enhances the tunability of molecular plasmonic resonance. The results
provide novel insights into the development and utilization of molecular
plasmonic devices in practical applications.</p>

<p>It is well established that the long-range component of the thermal
van der Waals interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics becomes
short-range when an electrolyte is present between them, this is the
well known phenomenon of screening. In Phys. Rev. Lett, 133, 238002
(2024) it was shown that for a binary symmetric electrolyte, an electric
field parallel to the dielectric boundaries disrupts screening and a
long-range thermal repulsive interaction appears. At large applied
fields this long-range repulsive interaction can be explained by the
fact that the cations and anions have differing average drifts moving in
opposite directions, leading to the correlation of charge density
fluctuations between the two species to decouple. Here we extend these
results to binary electrolytes which are asymmetric as well as
electrolytes with more than two ionic species.</p>

<p>Glass transition is a reversible transition that occurs in most
amorphous materials. However, the nature of glass transition remains far
from being clarified. A key to understand the glass transition is to
clarify what determines the glass transition temperature (Tg) and liquid
fragility (m). Here the glass transition thermodynamics for 150
different glass-forming systems are studied statistically. It is found
that the activation characters in the energy landscape are crucial to
precisely portray the glass transition and, in particular, both the
activation free energy (G) and the activation entropy (S) play critical
roles. Gdetermines Tg, Tg=G/290+25.5, while Sdetermines m, m=S/Rln10+15
with R is gas constant. Based on the Boltzmann definition of entropy,
the fragility is an indication of the number of the degeneracy of the
evolution paths. This explains why the nano-confined, low-dimension or
high-pressured glasses exhibit stronger characteristics, which has been
a puzzling phenomenon for a long time.</p>

<p>This study introduces a framework that employs Gaussian Processes
(GPs) to develop high-fidelity equation of state (EOS) tables, essential
for modeling material properties across varying temperatures and
pressures. GPs offer a robust predictive modeling approach and are
especially adept at handling uncertainties systematically. By
integrating Error-in-Variables (EIV) into the GP model, we adeptly
navigate uncertainties in both input parameters (like temperature and
density) and output variables (including pressure and other
thermodynamic properties). Our methodology is demonstrated using
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) data for gold,
observing its properties over maximum density compression (up to 100
g/cc) and extreme temperatures within the warm dense matter region
(reaching 300 eV). Furthermore, we assess the resilience of our
uncertainty propagation within the resultant EOS tables under various
conditions, including data scarcity and the intrinsic noise of
experiments and simulations.</p>

<p>Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of
DNA is fundamental for its biological function and the design of novel
drugs. In this study, we introduce an improved coarse-grained (CG)
model, incorporating a more refined electrostatic energy term, the
replica-exchange Monte Carlo algorithm, and the weighted histogram
analysis method. The enhanced model predicts the 3D structures and
stability of DNA with multi-way junctions (three-way and four-way) in
various ionic environments, going beyond traditional single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Our model demonstrates
remarkable accuracy in predicting the structures of DNAs with multi-way
junctions from sequences and offers reliable estimates of their thermal
stability across a range of sequences and lengths, with both monovalent
and divalent salts. Notably, our analysis of the thermally unfolding
pathways reveals that the stability of DNA with multi-way junctions is
strongly influenced by the relative stabilities of their unfolded
intermediate states, providing key insights into DNA structure-function
relationships.</p>

out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter

exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further
investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron
quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed

according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data
obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral
characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it
evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at <span
class="math inline">\(T^\ast\)</span> well above <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}\)</span>. This pseudogap
behavior is consistent with <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>SR
Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation
of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron
quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the
onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second
important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related
magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation
rate <span class="math inline">\(1/T_1T\)</span> and the evolution of
the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at <span
class="math inline">\(T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}\)</span> and rule out even a
proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the
spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by

<p>Lamellar or smectic phases often have an intricate intralamellar
structure that remains scarcely understood from a microscopic viewpoint.
In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect
of volume exclusion and electrostatic repulsion on the phase transitions
of a flat membrane of soft spherocylinders. With increasing rod packing,
we identify nematic and solid phases and find that the nematic-crystal
phase transition happens at a uniform packing fraction (<span
class="math inline">\(\eta_c \approx 0.82\)</span>), independent of the
spherocylinder aspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than the
well-known critical freezing transition of a hard disk fluid (<span
class="math inline">\(\eta_c \approx 0.7\)</span>) to which one could
naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers.
We attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientational
entropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory based
on a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of a
two-dimensional rod fluid. Introduction of electrostatic interactions
between the rods reduces the lateral compressibility of the monolayer
fluid but keeps the positional order unhindered, which in turn maintains
the packing fraction at the nematic-crystal transition. The strength of
the orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranes
exhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Our
findings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystal
phase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recent
experimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.</p>

<p>Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and
evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and
animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing
capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build
metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a
contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape
changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by
progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local
stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for
all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape
changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break
reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn
allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our
findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical
learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning
to design adaptive materials and robots.</p>

<p>Ultrafast real-time dynamics are critical for understanding a broad
range of physical processes. Real-time time-dependent density functional
theory (rt-TDDFT) has emerged as a powerful computational tool for
simulating these dynamics, offering insight into untrafast processes and
light-matter interactions. In periodic systems, the velocity gauge is
essential because it preserves the system's periodicity under an
external electric field. Numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) are widely
employed in rt-TDDFT codes due to their efficiency and localized nature.
However, directly applying the velocity gauge within the NAO basis set
neglects the position-dependent phase variations within atomic orbitals
induced by the vector potential, leading to significant computational
errors-particularly in current calculations. To resolve this issue, we
develop a hybrid gauge that incorporates both the electric field and the
vector potential, preserving the essential phase information in atomic
orbitals and thereby eliminating these errors. Our benchmark results
demonstrate that the hybrid gauge fully resolves the issues encountered
with the velocity gauge in NAO-based calculations, providing accurate
and reliable results. This algorithm offers a robust framework for
future studies on ultrafast dynamics in periodic systems using NAO
bases.</p>

<p>In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange
interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within
the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality
becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We
explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality
in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied
electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment (<span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), modifying the spin-orbit
interaction (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{L}.\hat{S}\)</span>). This
modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state
in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality
(<span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>). To validate the presence of
chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the
Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The
initial state was prepared as a superposition <span
class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})\)</span>, and its
time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a
distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces.
This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state
remains stable over an extended period.</p>

Customarily, high sensitivity resonant techniques, intrinsically

<p>Spin dynamics in Al-substituted yttrium iron garnets is investigated
using broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the temperature
range T=200-360 K. Using the measured data, the resonance field and
linewidth as well as their temperature dependence are determined, with
implications for the uniformity and overall quality of the samples
prepared via different chemical fabrication routes. These key parameters
governing the spin dynamics in the material are important for its
applications in high-speed spintronic and magnonic devices.</p>

<p>Basic principles of ferroelectric activity induced by the
noncollinear spins are reviewed. There is a fundamental reason why the
inversion symmetry can be broken by magnetic order. Such situation
occurs when the magnetic order simultaneously involves ferromagnetic
(<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>) and antiferromagnetic (<span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) patterns, transforming under the
spatial inversion <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}\)</span> and
time reversal <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}F=F\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{IT}A=A\)</span>. The incompatibility of
these two conditions breaks the inversion symmetry, imposing a
constraint on possible dependencies of polarization on directions of
spins, which can include only antisymmetric coupling and single-ion
anisotropy in the from <span class="math inline">\(\vec{P} =
\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12} [ \boldsymbol{e}_{1} \times
\boldsymbol{e}_{2} ] + \boldsymbol{e}_{1} \vec{\mathbb{\Pi}}
\boldsymbol{e}_{1} - \boldsymbol{e}_{2} \vec{\mathbb{\Pi}}
\boldsymbol{e}_{2}\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12}\)</span> can
be evaluated in the framework of superexchange theory, resulting in
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}}_{12} \sim
\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}^{\phantom{0}}\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}^{\phantom{0}}\)</span>
is the part of the position operator produced by the spin-orbit
coupling. <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}\)</span>
remains invariant under <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}\)</span>, explaining why noncollinear
spins can induce <span class="math inline">\(\vec{P}\)</span> even in
the centrosymmetric case. The properties of <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}_{12}\)</span> are
rationalized from the viewpoint of symmetry of the Kramers states. The
Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky rule <span class="math inline">\(\vec{P}
\propto \vec{\epsilon}_{21} \times [\boldsymbol{e}_{1} \times
\boldsymbol{e}_{2}]\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(\vec{\epsilon}_{21}\)</span> being the bond
direction) is justified only for relatively high symmetry. The
single-ion anisotropy vanishes for the spin 1/2 or if magnetic ions are
located in the inversion centers. The properties of known multiferroics
are reconsidered from the viewpoint of these principles.</p>

<p>Hydrogenated amorphous carbon thin films (a:C-H) are very promising
materials for numerous applications. The growing of relevance of a:C-H
is mainly due to the long-term stability of their outstanding
properties. For improving their performances, a full understanding of
their local chemistry is highly required. Fifteen years ago, electron
energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), developed in a transmission electron
microscope (TEM), was the technique of choice to extract such kind of
quantitative information on these materials. Other optical techniques,
as Raman spectroscopy, are now clearly favored by the scientific
community. However, they still lack of the spatial resolution offered by
TEM-EELS. In addition, nowadays, the complexity of the physics phenomena
behind EELS is better known. Here, a:C-H thin films have been
isothermally annealed and the evolution of their physical and chemical
parameters have been monitored at the local and macroscopic scales. In
particular, chemical in-depth inhomogeneities and their origins are
highlighted. Furthermore, a novel procedure to extract properly and
reliably quantitative chemical information from EEL spectra is
presented. Finally, the pertinence of empirical models used by the Raman
community is discussed. These works demonstrate the pertinence of the
combination of local and macroscopic analyses for a proper study of such
complex materials.</p>

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals compounds exhibit interesting
electronic and magnetic properties due to complex intra-layer and
inter-layer interactions, which are of immense importance in realizing
exotic physics as well as advanced technology. Various experimental and
theoretical studies led to significantly different ground state
properties often contrasting each other. Here, we studied a novel 2D
material, CrSiTe3 employing magnetic, specific heat and Raman
measurements. Experimental results reveal evidence of incipient
antiferromagnetism below 1 kOe concomitant to ferromagnetic order at 33
K. Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions coexists at low
field in the temperature regime, 15 - 33 K. Low field data reveal an
additional magnetic order below 15 K, which melts on application of
external magnetic field and remain dark in the heat capacity data. Raman
spectra exhibit anomalies at the magnetic transitions; an evidence of
strong spin-lattice coupling. Below 15 K, Eg modes exhibit hardening
while Ag modes become significantly softer suggesting weakening of the
inter-layer coupling at low temperatures which might be a reason for the
unusual magnetic ground state and field induced melting of the magnetic
order. These results reveal evidence of exceptional ground state
properties linked to spin-lattice coupling and also suggest a pathway to
study complex magnetism in such technologically important materials.</p>

bound states in the normal region account for dissipationless
supercurrent and play a central role in determining exotic properties.
Recently, an intriguing aspect of the multiterminal Josephson junctions
has been proposed to study the topological properties, wherein the
Andreev bound states acquire topological characteristics upon tuning the
phase differences of superconducting terminals. In this work, we
investigate topologically non-trivial phases in four-terminal Josephson
junctions based on square and graphene lattices. Additionally, we apply
a gating potential that smoothly drives the Andreev bound states from a
topologically non-trivial state to a trivial state. Furthermore, we
observe that the gating potential in our setup produces the similar
physics of the topological Andreev bound states of the double (single)
quantum-dot multiterminal Josephson junctions when the gating potential
is small (large) compared to the superconducting gap.</p>

<p>Ionic polymer actuators, in essence, consist of ion exchange polymers
sandwiched between layers of electrodes. They have recently gained
recognition as promising candidates for soft actuators due to their
lightweight nature, noise-free operation, and low-driving voltages.
However, the materials traditionally utilized to develop them are often
not human/environmentally friendly. Thus, to address this issue,
researchers have been focusing on developing biocompatible versions of
this actuator. Despite this, such actuators still face challenges in
achieving high performance, in payload capacity, bending capabilities,
and response time. In this paper, we present a biocompatible ionic
polymer actuator whose membrane is fully 3D printed utilizing a direct
ink writing method. The structure of the printed membranes consists of
biodegradable ionic fluid encapsulated within layers of activated carbon
polymers. From the microscopic observations of its structure, we
confirmed that the ionic polymer is well encapsulated. The actuators can
achieve a bending performance of up to 124<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> (curvature of 0.82 <span
class="math inline">\(\text{cm}^{-1}\)</span>), which, to our knowledge,
is the highest curvature attained by any bending ionic polymer actuator
to date. It can operate comfortably up to a 2 Hz driving frequency and
can achieve blocked forces of up to 0.76 mN. Our results showcase a
promising, high-performing biocompatible ionic polymer actuator, whose
membrane can be easily manufactured in a single step using a standard
FDM 3D printer. This approach paves the way for creating customized
designs for functional soft robotic applications, including
human-interactive devices, in the near future.</p>

<p>The functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials with organic
molecules is a promising approach for realizing nanoscale optoelectronic
devices with tailored functionalities, such as quantum light generation
and p-n junctions. However, achieving control over the molecules'
precise positioning on the 2D material remains a significant challenge.
Here, we overcome the limitations of solution- and vapor deposition
methods and use a DNA origami placement technique to spatially arrange
various organic molecules on a chip surface at the single-molecule level
with high assembly yields. This versatile method allows for precise
patterning of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with organic
molecules, including thiols and fluorescent dyes. We successfully
integrated MoS<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> monolayers with
micron-scale molecule-origami patterns achieving both single photon
emission from thiol-induced localized excitons in MoS<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> and photoexcitation energy transfer
with patterned fluorescent dyes. Our approach offers a pathway for
producing complex, tailored 2D inorganic-organic heterostructures with
molecular-level control, opening up new possibilities for advanced
materials and device design.</p>

<p>Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground
state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat,
magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate
that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct
single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic
sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing
crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge
model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic
exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both
chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The
strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size
of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low
dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the
lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet
nature of its ground state.</p>

<p>Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for studies of molecules,
liquids and solids. While Raman spectra can be obtained theoretically
from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculation
of the electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory.
First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability are
computationally expensive, motivating the development of atomistic
models for the evaluation of the changes in the electronic
polarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system.
The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplest
such atomistic models, but cannot reproduce the effects of angular
vibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, we
demonstrate that the generalization of BPM through inclusion of terms
for atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved in
bonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modeling
and Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproduces
the ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of tested
molecules (SO2, H2S, H2O, NH3, CH4, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH) with high
accuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initio
results for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO3 systems. For liquid
water, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MD
simulations using GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantly
improved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to the
spectrum derived using BPM. Thus, GBPM can be used for the modeling of
Raman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a good
basis for the further development of atomistic polarizability
models.</p>

<p>Metal-stuffed B-C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have
captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional
superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure.
However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing
studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight
system. Here, using state-of-the-art initiomethods incorporating quantum
effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a
series of <span
class="math inline">\(XY\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}\)</span> clathrates
where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are metals. Our findings show that
ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the <span
class="math inline">\(E_g\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(E_u\)</span> vibrational modes, enabling the
dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in
the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously
unreported <span class="math inline">\((XY)^{1+}\)</span> state, which
is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures.
Further calculations based on the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation
demonstrate that the <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> values for
<span class="math inline">\(\text{KRbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\text{RbB}_{3}\text{C}_{3}\)</span> among

respectively, both being higher than <span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> of 77 K of <span
class="math inline">\(\text{KPbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}\)</span> at the
anharmonic level. These record-high <span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> values, surpassing liquid nitrogen
temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in
stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength
and advancing the search for high-<span

<p>The unique properties of plastic crystals highlight their potential
for use in solid-state refrigeration. However, their practical
applications are limited by thermal hysteresis due to low thermal
conductivity. In this study, the effect of compressive strain on the
thermal transport properties of plastic crystal [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] was
investigated using molecular dynamic simulation with a deep neural
network potential. It is found that a 9% strain along [001] direction
enhances thermal conductivity sixfold. The underlying mechanisms are
analyzed through vibrational density of states, spectral energy
densities, and mean square displacements. The enhancement in thermal
conductivity is primarily due to increased group velocity and reduced
phonon scattering, driven by volume compression within the 0-1 THz.
These findings offer theoretical insights for the practical application
of plastic crystals in thermal management systems.</p>

<p>The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum
dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem
in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)
has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity
of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the
underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of
such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical
predictions for several high-T<span class="math inline">\(_c\)</span>

phonons, we find that the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{q_\parallel}\)</span>-dependence of the
RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon
mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results
cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic
structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS
provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be
used to test advanced theoretical predictions.</p>

<p>The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established
as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum
systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's
Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D
metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a
even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a
certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has
now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms.
They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires,
topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms,
Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and
spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations
become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no
long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate
the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world
systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the
other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the
quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems
in one dimension.</p>

<p>In ultrathin ferromagnetic films sandwiched between two distinct
heavy metal layers or between a heavy metal and an oxide layer, the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is recognized as being of
interfacial origin. Its chirality and strength are determined by the
properties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation at
the interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the chirality of the DMI can
change solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagnetic
layer - an effect that has not been experimentally observed or explained
until now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer system
Ta/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that
variations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the
interface, driven by the number of ferromagnetic atomic layers, lead to
an inversion of DMI chirality. This mechanism takes place for
ferromagnetic layers with more than three atomic layers, for which the
two interfaces start to be decoupled. We hence propose a new degree of
freedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures by
tailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acoustic
waves.</p>

<p>We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled
fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where
the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is
clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions
in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are
subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the
entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and
its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of
quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and
quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize
the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy.
Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct
characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page
value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir
and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections
with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide
variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</p>

<p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit two distinct topological
classifications based on their gap structure: line-gap and point-gap
topologies. Although point-gap topology is intrinsic to non-Hermitian
systems, its systematic construction remains a challenge. Here, we
present the Floquet engineering approach for realizing point-gapped
topological superconductors. By combining Floquet theory with
particle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robust
Majorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands with
opposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weak
non-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving a
topological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{PT}\)</span>) symmetry. This transition
is accompanied by the appearance of the Floquet <span
class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span> skin effect. Furthermore, the
point-gapped topological phase and the non-Bloch <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{PT}\)</span> symmetry exhibit
size-dependent phenomena driven by the critical skin effect. Our work
offers a new pathway for exploring the point-gapped topological phases
in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

<p>We investigate de Gennes and Saint-James states and Josephson effect
in hybrid junctions based on <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave
altermagnet and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave
superconductor. In a normal metal/altermagnet/<span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave superconductor junction, we find
that the <span
class="math inline">\(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\)</span>-altermagnet can generate
de Gennes and Saint-James states in a short junction due to the enhanced
mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors, resulting in the
vanishing zero-biased conductance peak with pronounced resonance spikes
in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the de Gennes and
Saint-James states are not found for <span
class="math inline">\(d_{xy}\)</span>-altermagnet in the short junction
but can be formed in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known
features such as V-shape conductance for <span
class="math inline">\(d_{x^2-y^2}\)</span> pairings and zero-biased
conductance peak for <span class="math inline">\(d_{xy}\)</span>
pairings are not affected by the strength of <span
class="math inline">\(d_{xy}\)</span>-altermagnetism in the short
junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I( ) $ of
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave
superconductor/altermagnet/<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave
superconductor hybrids, where $$ is the macroscopic phase difference
between two <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-wave superconductors.
In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such
as a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-<span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> transition by changing either the
orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and
dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the
first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $
d_{x<sup>{2}-y</sup>{2}}<span
class="math inline">\(-superconductor/altermagnet/\)</span>d_{xy}$-superconductor
junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither
<span class="math inline">\(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\)</span>- nor $
d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the
anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to
the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

<p>The average state dynamics of free fermions subject to random
projective measurements of local site occupation numbers is governed by
a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuous limit, the
equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a
hydrodynamic equation for the Wigner function, which takes the form of a
linear, nonlocal partial differential equation. As a main result, we
derive the analytical solution to the hydrodynamic equation using the
quasiparticle picture, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from
stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an
application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive
transport regimes.</p>

<p>The coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes are studied in a
FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite bulk crystal, using time-resolved Kerr
ellipticity in a two-color pump-probe scheme. The probe photon energy is
tuned to the exciton resonance, while the pump photon energy is detuned
from it up to 0.75 eV to higher energies. The spin-oriented electrons
and holes photogenerated with significant excess kinetic energy relax
into states in vicinity of the band gap, where they undergo Larmor
precession in an external magnetic field. At cryogenic temperatures down
to 1.6 K, the spin dephasing time reaches the nanosecond range. During
energy relaxation, the carrier spin relaxation is inefficient and only
happens when the carriers become localized. In experiments with two pump
pulses, all-optical control of the amplitudes and phases of the electron
and hole spin signals is achieved in the additive regime by varying the
intensities of the pump pulses and the time delay between them.</p>

<p>Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework for
studying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extending
this approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents several
important challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berry
phase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}\)</span> symmetry is
broken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using
the bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations of
motion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system.
Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces both
an anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM.
To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane model
featuring non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the
imbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent
`complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components of
the complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginary
parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction and
dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings are
confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics.
Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex
Haldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a
promising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p>A microscopic vision is presented of a Dual Model of Liquids from a
solid picture. Among the novelties of this model is that it provides
quantitative expressions of various extensive thermophysical properties.
The introduction of the statistical number of excited degrees of freedom
(DoF) allows bypassing the problem of other dual models which are
sometimes unable to correctly reproduce the expressions for those
thermophysical quantities showing deviations due to the activation or
deactivation of internal DoF. The interpretation of the relaxation times
is given, their Order of Magnitude calculated and the way in which these
times are involved in the different phases of the collective dynamics of
liquids is discussed. A comparison is provided with results obtained in
the frame of another phononic model of liquids, as well as with the
predictions for the viscoelastic transition regions and with systems
exhibiting kgap. In the last part of the paper, theoretical insights and
experiments are suggested as potential directions for future research
and development.</p>

<p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical
properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that
characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced
NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to
arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We
investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently
proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using
mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that
the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling
exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic
phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. In contrast to the
semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which
occurs at a finite critical value of <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, in the depleted lattice, the
transition at <span class="math inline">\(U=0\)</span> is associated
with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental
nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory
(LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit
and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter <span
class="math inline">\(m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146\)</span>. The order
parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings
indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the
magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

<p>In systems with detailed balance, the stationary distribution and the
equilibrium distribution are identical, creating a clear connection
between energetic and entropic quantities. Many driven systems violate
detailed balance and still pose a challenge for a consistent
thermodynamic interpretation. Even steady-state potentials like entropy
or free energy are no longer state variables. Here, we use a framework
for systems with broken detailed balance, where Boltzmann entropy can be
computed while properly taking constraints on state transitions into
account. As an illustration, we establish the thermodynamic relations
for arbitrarily driven sample space-reducing processes that are
non-equilibrium but show steady states. We demonstrate that, despite
explicitly broken detailed balance, it remains feasible to define and
unambiguously interpret the effective thermodynamic potentials.</p>

<p>This study introduces a modeling approach aimed at elucidating the
pivotal role of symmetry in phase transitions, focusing specifically on
the isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition characteristic of liquid crystal
systems. By leveraging insights from the Ising model and incorporating
considerations of topological defects, the transition to the glassy
state in rod-like molecular systems in the supercooled state is
examined. Through a critical-like analysis of the system's dynamical
properties, universality classes directly linked to symmetry are
discerned. This paper delves into the role of symmetry in the glass
transition, as manifested in the generalized critical relation of
configurational entropy <span
class="math inline">\(S_C(T)=S_0(1-T_K/T)^n\)</span>, where the critical
exponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is intricately tied to
the system's symmetry. The determined values of the pseudocritical
exponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> exhibit universality
across the studied systems and demonstrate excellent agreement with
thermodynamic data. Furthermore, the congruence between the dynamic
representation, as indicated by the primary relaxation time, and the
thermodynamic representation, exemplified by the specific heat capacity,
underscores the robustness of the findings. The identification of
critical-like behavior and the observation of symmetry breaking during
the transition to the glass state suggest its intrinsic thermodynamic
nature. This work provides a unified framework for understanding the
glass transition, bridging dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives
through the lens of symmetry.</p>

<p>We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform
extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting
hydrides. A cubic structure Li<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>AuH<span
class="math inline">\(_6\)</span> with Au-H octahedral motifs is
identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis,
we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material
via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further
first-principles calculations suggest that Li<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>AuH<span
class="math inline">\(_6\)</span> shows a high superconducting
transition temperature (<span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>) <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 140 K under ambient pressure. The
H-1<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> electrons strongly couple with
phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of
Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously
similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching
metallic covalent bonds to find high-<span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> superconductors, we emphasize here
the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon
coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into
binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with
strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-<span
class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> superconductors within multicomponent
compounds.</p>

<p>We present a systematic study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode
effect (JDE) in strongly spin-polarized ferromagnets (sFM) coupled to
singlet superconductors (SC) via ferromagnetic insulating interfaces
(FI). All metallic parts are described in the framework of the
quasiclassical Usadel Green's function theory applicable to diffusive
systems. The interfaces are characterized by an S-matrix obtained for a
model potential with exchange vectors pointing in an arbitrary direction
with respect to the magnetization in the sFM. Our theory predicts a
large charge Josephson diode effect with an efficiency exceeding <span
class="math inline">\(33\%\)</span> and a perfect spin diode effect with
<span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> efficiency. To achieve these
the following conditions are necessary: (i) a noncoplanar profile of the
three magnetization vectors in the system and (ii) different densities
of states of spin-<span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> and
spin-<span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span> bands in the sFM
achieved by a strong spin polarization. The former gives rise to the
quantum-geometric phase, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\varphi\)</span>, that enters the theory in
a very similar manner as the superconducting phase difference across the
junction, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\chi\)</span>. We perform a
harmonic analysis of the Josephson current in both variables and find
symmetries between Fourier coefficients allowing an interpretation in
terms of transfer processes of multiple equal-spin Cooper pairs across
the two ferromagnetic spin bands. We point out the importance of crossed
pair transmission processes. Finally, we study a spin-switching effect
of an equal-spin supercurrent by reversing the magnetic flux in a SQUID
device incorporating the mentioned junction and propose a way for
measuring it.</p>

<p>Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous
catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model
for Cu nanoparticles on three Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> surfaces (<span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(100), <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(110), and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(0001)). Using DP-accelerated
simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle stability
and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles
diffuse several times faster on <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(0001) than on <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(100) at 800 K while expected to be
more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is
facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al
atoms switch out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the
nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away.
In contrast, the MSI on <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(100) and on <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(110) is dominated by more stable and
directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed
on these surfaces. Our extended long-time MD simulations provide
quantitative insights into the sintering processes, showing that the
dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial inter-nanoparticle distance)
strongly influences coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We
observed that the coalescence of Cu<span
class="math inline">\(_{13}\)</span> nanoparticles on <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(0001) can occur in a short time (10
ns) at 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased
to 30 Å, while the coalescence on <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>-Al<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>(100) is inhibited significantly by
increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15 Å to 30 Å.
These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface
is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance
for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support
morphology.</p>

<p>We reply to McCulloch and Osborne's recent comment on our manuscript
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)) on controlled bond expansion (CBE)
for density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground state search. We
appreciate their suggestion to consider randomized SVD and address their
constructive critique on the variational properties of CBE-DMRG.
However, we strongly disagree with their proposal to omit the projection
to the 2-site tangent space and explain its importance for efficient
bond expansion. In particular, in the context of CBE applied to the
time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), we show that omitting this
projection can lead to avoidable errors. Lastly, we emphasize the
complementary roles of 3S mixing and CBE, reiterating our recommendation
from Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023) to combine both methods
(CBE+<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>). We provide examples
to demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of CBE+<span

<p>Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity
is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas
the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood,
materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a
clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon
coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples
for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various
compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional
mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we
report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering

<p>We study the static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain
modified by the inclusion of an effective, spherically symmetric,
attracting potential of entropic nature , is the position vector of ring
center of mass, is the position vector of the segment with number n, is
the Boltzmann constant multiplied on absolute temperature, is a
parameter of the potential, square of which is inverse to strength of
the potential. It is shown that very weak potentials with , N is the
number Kuhn segments in polymer ring, b is the length of Kuhn segment,
lead to dramatic compression of the polymer chain whose radius of
inertia becomes much smaller compared to the free size At values of the
potential parameter of order , is the concentration of Kuhn segments in
the melt, the concentration of the intrinsic segments of the polymer
ring becomes of order and the state of the polymer ring can be regarded
as globular. The terminal relaxation time of the polymer ring turns out
to be of the order of , the mean squared displacement of the center of
mass of the macromolecule during this time , which can lead to a pseudo
plateau for the time dependence of the mean squared displacements of the
polymer segments before entering the normal diffusion mode of
motion.</p>

<p>Engineering all fundamental magnetic phases within a single material
platform would mark a significant milestone in materials science and
spintronics, reducing complexity and costs in device fabrication by
eliminating the need for integrating and interfacing different
materials. Here, we demonstrate that graphene can host all
non-relativistic magnetic phases-namely, diamagnetism, paramagnetism,
ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, altermagnetism and
fully compensated ferrimagnetism -- by using single hydrogen atoms as
building blocks. Through precise manipulation of these atoms by scanning
tunneling microscopy, we can experimentally create all such magnetic
phases. Their different magnetic character is confirmed by density
functional theory and mean-field Hubbard calculations. In particular, we
show that the new magnetic paradigm known as altermagnetism can be
realized, exhibiting directionally spin-split energy bands coexisting
with zero net magnetization due to protecting spatial symmetries. It is
furthermore possible to create fully compensated ferrimagnets, lacking
these symmetries and therefore presenting unrestricted spin splitting of
the bands, with a vanishing net magnetization which in this case is
protected by Lieb's theorem. These findings put forward H-functionalized
graphene as a versatile platform to design, build and study these new
emergent magnetic phases at the atomic scale.</p>

<p>We introduce a reinforcement learning method for a class of
non-Markov systems; our approach extends the actor-critic framework
given by Rose et al. [New J. Phys. 23 013013 (2021)] for obtaining
scaled cumulant generating functions characterizing the fluctuations.
The actor-critic is implemented using neural networks; a particular
innovation in our method is the use of an additional neural policy for
processing memory variables. We demonstrate results for current
fluctuations in various memory-dependent models with special focus on
semi-Markov systems where the dynamics is controlled by nonexponential
interevent waiting time distributions.</p>

<p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the
durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization.
Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies
on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting
experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk
materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction
imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field
evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316
stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced
mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics
simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and
climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally,
nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures
hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally
validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into
hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior, paving the way for the design of
HE-resistant materials.</p>
